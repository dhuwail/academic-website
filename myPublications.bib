	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is taking a toll on the world's health care infrastructure as well as the social, economic, and psychological well-being of humanity. Individuals, organizations, and governments are using social media to communicate with each other on a number of issues relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. Not much is known about the topics being shared on social media platforms relating to COVID-19. Analyzing such information can help policy makers and health care organizations assess the needs of their stakeholders and address them appropriately.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the main topics posted by Twitter users related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: Leveraging a set of tools (Twitter's search application programming interface (API), Tweepy Python library, and PostgreSQL database) and using a set of predefined search terms ("corona," "2019-nCov," and "COVID-19"), we extracted the text and metadata (number of likes and retweets, and user profile information including the number of followers) of public English language tweets from February 2, 2020, to March 15, 2020. We analyzed the collected tweets using word frequencies of single (unigrams) and double words (bigrams). We leveraged latent Dirichlet allocation for topic modeling to identify topics discussed in the tweets. We also performed sentiment analysis and extracted the mean number of retweets, likes, and followers for each topic and calculated the interaction rate per topic.
RESULTS: Out of approximately 2.8 million tweets included, 167,073 unique tweets from 160,829 unique users met the inclusion criteria. Our analysis identified 12 topics, which were grouped into four main themes: origin of the virus; its sources; its impact on people, countries, and the economy; and ways of mitigating the risk of infection. The mean sentiment was positive for 10 topics and negative for 2 topics (deaths caused by COVID-19 and increased racism). The mean for tweet topics of account followers ranged from 2722 (increased racism) to 13,413 (economic losses). The highest mean of likes for the tweets was 15.4 (economic loss), while the lowest was 3.94 (travel bans and warnings).
CONCLUSIONS: Public health crisis response activities on the ground and online are becoming increasingly simultaneous and intertwined. Social media provides an opportunity to directly communicate health information to the public. Health systems should work on building national and international disease detection and surveillance systems through monitoring social media. There is also a need for a more proactive and agile public health presence on social media to combat the spread of fake news.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mental disorders are a major public health problem leading to premature mortality, homelessness, addiction problems, poor physical health, and suicide. The prevalence of mental disorders in Arab countries, is high. The proliferation and ubiquity of smartphones and their apps in the Arab world may be the long-awaited for digital therapeutic for mental health disorders. However, the evidence about the availability and characteristics of mental health apps available to Arabic speakers remains poor.
OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic assessment of the features of depression and anxiety mobile apps available for Arabic speakers.
METHODS: A critical review of all the currently available depression and anxiety apps, available free of charge to Arabic speakers. The apps are evaluated using the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS). Further, a categorization of apps' main functions, inspired by the mhGAP guidelines, is developed to classify the apps based on their main functions.
RESULTS: A total of 23 apps are identified with far more apps available on the Google Play Store (n = 21) versus only two apps on the iOS App Store. The majority of the apps (n = 16) provide general information about either anxiety, depression, or both. Six apps are of spiritual nature mainly referring to the Islamic faith and the Holy Quran, with one app referring to the Christian faith. Another five apps provide advice on alternative treatments, mainly concerning herbal medicine recipes. Only two apps provided utilities for users, specifically about medication reminders.
CONCLUSIONS: Mental health digi-threaputics have huge potentials to transform mental health care delivery. However, more empirical studies are needed to assure their quality and efficacy. The results of this study clearly highlight the current gaps to address the needs of Arabic speakers; only 23 apps were identified in this study, mostly with low app quality scores. There is a need to involve expert healthcare professionals in the development of mental health apps and for healthcare providers to empower patients through discussing apps that are useful and discern them from those that can potentially cause harm.},

The current qualitative study uncovers the challenges and opportunities of home health agencies (HHAs) in achieving better fall risk management. A secondary document analysis was adopted to learn from rich contextual information in fall incident reports recorded in a HHA. Poor engagement of patients and caregivers was a contributing factor in many fall incidents. Patients often fell as a result of not understanding or accepting their physical limitations. For better fall risk management, many incidents highlighted a need for providing complete and thorough care, better coordination of care, higher levels of sociocultural awareness, patient engagement, and caregiver involvement. The results provide evidence regarding the challenges and opportunities for improving fall risk management in home care along with insight about how information technology solutions can support improvement initiatives.

In this study, we used Kuwait as an example of a high per-capita gross domestic product country that faces information management challenges to draw insights that can be generalised to other developed countries.
OBJECTIVE: (i) to uncover the status quo of information management practices in public hospitals and (ii) to offer recommendations to improve them.
METHOD: This study analysed qualitative and quantitative accreditation-related data pertaining to the compliance with the information management standard at all secondary care public hospitals over two accreditation cycles.
RESULTS: Overall, public hospitals had made positive progress in their compliance with the information management standard. However, issues still existed with (i) developing and implementing an information management plan, (ii) involving the appropriate stakeholders in selecting health IT solutions and (iii) access to the Internet by staff and patients.
CONCLUSION: Evidence underscored the importance of proper information management driven by clear centralised strategic plans.
IMPLICATIONS: With the rapid adoption of digital health systems, the role of health information management leaders should not be undervalued. Embracing health IT solutions with strong information management practices can aid healthcare reform efforts.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12911-018-0660-4},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current advances in information and communication technology have made accessing and obtaining health-related information easier than ever before. Today, many hospital websites use a patient-centric approach to promote engagement and encourage learning for better health-related decision making. However, little is known about the current state of hospital websites in the State of Kuwait. This study aims to evaluate hospital websites in Kuwait and offer recommendations to improve patient engagement and access to health information.
METHODS: This study employs a cross-sectional analytical approach to evaluate hospital websites in Kuwait in 2017. The websites of hospitals that provide in-patient services were identified through a structured search. Only active websites that were available in either English or Arabic were considered. The evaluation of the websites involved a combination of automated and expert- based evaluation methods and was performed across four dimensions: Accessibility, Usability, Presence, and Content.
RESULTS: Nine hospitals met the inclusion criteria. Most of the websites fell short in all four dimensions. None of the websites passed the accessibility guidelines. The usability of websites varied between hospitals. Overall, the majority of hospitals in Kuwait have rudimentary online presence and their websites require careful reassessment with respect to design, content, and user experience. The websites focus primarily on promoting services provided by the hospital rather than engaging and communicating with patients or providing evidence-based information.
CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare organization and website developers should follow best-practices to improve their websites taking into consideration the quality, readability, objectivity, coverage and currency of the information as well as the design of their websites. Hospitals should leverage social media to gain outreach and better engagement with consumers. The websites should be offered in additional languages commonly spoken by people living in Kuwait. Efforts should be made to ensure that health information on hospital websites are evidence-based and checked by healthcare professionals.},

	doi = {10.2196/11174},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The internet and social media have become an important source for health information. In 2017, the State of Kuwait ranked first in mobile subscription penetration in the Arab world; nearly 90\% of its population uses the internet. Electronic health (eHealth) literacy is important in populations that have easy and affordable access to internet resources to more effectively manage health conditions as well as improve general population health.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess eHealth literacy levels across internet users in Kuwait and identify demographic characteristics that influence eHealth literacy. Furthermore, the study aimed to identify the reasons and type of information that people seek online. Finally, this study examined the utilization of various social media channels for accessing online health information. The social media platforms considered were as follows: WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, and Snapchat.
METHODS: A cross-sectional anonymous Web-based survey was used to collect data about eHealth literacy and related information. The eHealth literacy scale (eHEALS), originally developed by Norman and Skinner, is measured using 8 Likert-type scales. A linear regression model estimates the effect of demographic variables such as age, gender, and education on eHealth literacy while controlling for participants' perceived usefulness and importance of the internet. Participants were also surveyed about their frequency in using social media platforms for seeking health information.
RESULTS: Kuwait's composite eHEALS, based on a sample of 386 participants, was 28.63, which is very similar to eHEALS observed among adult populations in other developed countries. Females in Kuwait demonstrated a higher average eHEALS compared with males. Among the social media platforms, the survey results indicated that YouTube is the most frequently used to seek health information, with Facebook being the least frequently used.
CONCLUSIONS: Internet users in Kuwait appear confident in their ability to search for health-related information online compared with other populations, as indicated by aggregate eHEALS scores. Considering this finding, government and health care organizations should shift more efforts from traditional media toward online health information, focusing on the social media outlets that people in Kuwait find more useful for seeking health information.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To help manage the risk of falls in home care, this study aimed to (i) identify home care clinicians' information needs and how they manage missing or inaccurate data, (ii) identify problems that impact effectiveness and efficiency associated with retaining, exchanging, or processing information about fall risks in existing workflows and currently adopted health information technology (IT) solutions, and (iii) offer informatics-based recommendations to improve fall risk management interventions.
METHODS: A case study was carried out in a single not-for-profit suburban Medicare-certified home health agency with three branches. Qualitative data were collected over a six month period through observations, semi-structured interviews, and focus groups. The Framework method was used for analysis. Maximum variation sampling was adopted to recruit a diverse sample of clinicians.
RESULTS: Overall, the information needs for fall risk management were categorized into physiological, care delivery, educational, social, environmental, and administrative domains. Examples include a brief fall-related patient history, weight-bearing status, medications that affect balance, availability of caregivers at home, and the influence of patients' cultures on fall management interventions. The unavailability and inaccuracy of critical information related to fall risks can delay necessary therapeutic services aimed at reducing patients' risk for falling and thereby jeopardizing their safety. Currently adopted IT solutions did not adequately accommodate data related to fall risk management.
CONCLUSION: The results highlight the essential information for fall risk management in home care. Home care workflows and health IT solutions must effectively and efficiently retain, exchange, and process information necessary for fall risk management. Interoperability and integration of the various health IT solutions to make data sharing accessible to all clinicians is critical for fall risk management. Findings from this study can help home health agencies better understand their information needs to manage fall risks.},

METHODS: Twelve in-depth semistructured interviews with the patients and caregivers were conducted within a descriptive single case study design in 1 home health agency (HHA) in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States.
RESULTS: Patients and caregivers faced challenges to manage fall risks such as unmanaged expectations, deteriorating cognitive abilities, and poor care coordination between the HHA and physician practices. Opportunities to leverage health IT solutions included patient portals, telehealth, and medication reminder apps on smartphones.
CONCLUSION: Effectively leveraging health IT could further empower patients and caregivers to reduce fall risks by acquiring the necessary information and following clinical advice and recommendations. The HHAs could improve the quality of care by adopting IT solutions that show more promise of improving the experiences of patients and caregivers in fall-risk management.},

Study participants from 45 countries (n=469) ranked their satisfaction with the current state of nursing functionality in EHRs as relatively low. Two-thirds of the participants (n=283) provided disconcerting comments when explaining their low satisfaction rankings. More than one half of the comments identified issues at the system level (e.g., poor system usability; non-integrated systems and poor interoperability; lack of standards; and limited functionality/missing components), followed by user-task issues (e.g., failure of systems to meet nursing clinical needs; non nursing-specific systems) and environment issues (e.g., low prevalence of EHRs; lack of user training). The study results call for the attention of international stakeholders (educators, managers, policy makers) to improve the current issues with EHRs from a nursing perspective.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: As home care utilization increases, information technology (IT) becomes a critical tool for providing quality home care. However, most home health agencies (HHAs) in the United States are in a position to adopt and leverage IT solutions in budget-constrained settings, where it is crucial to address important and pressing challenges and opportunities for achieving effectiveness in IT adoption.
OBJECTIVES: (1) Explore HHAs' challenges and opportunities related to delivering home care as well as performing administrative functions and conducting business, (2) learn about current IT implementation levels and activities in home care, and (3) make recommendations to facilitate efforts and initiatives designed for adopting IT in home care effectively.
METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted to elicit rich contextual information from the participants recruited from 13 local HHAs in one of the states in the United States. Established systems analysis techniques were used to ask questions during the interviews. Framework, a qualitative research method, was used to analyze the qualitative data obtained from the interviews.
RESULTS: Coordinating clinical and administrative workflows was an important challenge. Inadequate access to patients' medical history and difficulties with medication reconciliation detracted from the quality of care. Hiring, training, scheduling, and retaining qualified personnel constituted another important challenge. Training and educating patients, caregivers, and families hold important opportunities for improving the quality of care. All except one HHA adopted electronic health records (EHR) but many continued to struggle considerably in their day-to-day functions. Health information exchange (HIE) seems to be the most needed technology. Telehealth solutions were perceived to be promising but their added value and financial viability in the long run were questioned.
CONCLUSIONS: The recommendations for effective IT adoption include keeping a quality improvement focus, keeping a holistic organizational perspective, considering potential information exchange problems, addressing education and training needs, experimentation with telehealth if resources permit, considering organization size, and reducing lengthy procedures and excessive documentation requirements. The relevant stakeholders, such as home care professionals, IT vendors, and policy makers, should consider the recommendations from this study to facilitate success in future IT efforts and initiatives in home care.},

METHODS: Qualitative research was conducted by following the Framework method. Rich contextual data were obtained through focus group meetings participated by domain experts. The analysis results were further refined in an online forum and validated at a final meeting.
RESULTS: Four focus groups involving a total of 20 participants resulted in useful discussions during which various perspectives were expressed by the expert participants. A well-defined set of 17 KPIDs emerged under four categories, namely, economical value, sociocultural sensitivity, interpersonal relationships, and clinical capabilities.
CONCLUSIONS: The feedback we received from the focus groups indicates that performance improvement in HHAs is a lot more complicated than simply assessing whether certain clinical tasks are performed. The KPIDs identified in this study can help HHAs in their focused and individualized QAPI initiatives. Therefore, the results should be immediately relevant, interesting, and useful to the home care industry and policy makers in the US.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Electronic Health Records (EHR) help physicians make effective decisions in patient care. With limited research in this area in Kuwait, we sought to identify the factors that contribute to the current use and satisfaction of EHR in Kuwait.

Methods
This cross-sectional study took place in a public hospital in 2019. Three-hundred ten physicians were recruited through convenience sampling (response rate: 95\%). The survey which was translated into Arabic, was self-administered and it contained 48 statements. The Technology Acceptance Model was used as the theoretical framework. The dependent variables were satisfaction with EHR and current use of EHR. The main independent variables were barriers of using the EHR, perceived level of ease for using EHR, and effect of EHR on the physicians' work. Descriptive analysis, followed by bivariate, multivariate linear regression adjusted for demographics were conducted.

Results
The study sample consisted of predominantly males (82\%), non-Kuwaiti (84\%), and of young age (42\% were 30-39 years old). The majority of the participants (76\%) were currently using the EHR system. The physicians' satisfaction with use of EHR system was moderate (Mean: 3.47, SD: 0.81, range 1.33-5). The EHR effect on the physicians' work was the most significant predictor of satisfaction (β = 0.491, p = 0.000), followed by the level of ease (β = 0.274, p = 0.000), and length of use of EHR (β = 0.100, p = 0.006). Perceptions of barriers was the strongest predictor of current use of EHR (β=-0. 417, p = 0.000), followed by level of ease (β = 0.227, p = 0.000) and quality of a related training (β = 0.195, p = 0.000).

Conclusions
In the promotion of EHR use and related satisfaction, making the use of EHR functions (e.g. registration of clinical notes) as easy as possible seems to be a key factor. Other factors to consider are removing the barriers physicians face, making the benefits of use of EHR visible, and ensuring a high quality related training.

Key messages
Most physicians in a Kuwaiti public hospital use the EHR system.

Perceived barriers, effect of EHR on the physicians’ work, and user-friendly application of EHR are associated with satisfaction and EHR use.},
