abstract: "Introduction Electronic Health Records (EHR) help physicians make effective\
  \ decisions in patient care. With limited research in this area in Kuwait, we sought\
  \ to identify the factors that contribute to the current use and satisfaction of\
  \ EHR in Kuwait.  Methods This cross-sectional study took place in a public hospital\
  \ in 2019. Three-hundred ten physicians were recruited through convenience sampling\
  \ (response rate: 95%). The survey which was translated into Arabic, was self-administered\
  \ and it contained 48 statements. The Technology Acceptance Model was used as the\
  \ theoretical framework. The dependent variables were satisfaction with EHR and\
  \ current use of EHR. The main independent variables were barriers of using the\
  \ EHR, perceived level of ease for using EHR, and effect of EHR on the physicians'\
  \ work. Descriptive analysis, followed by bivariate, multivariate linear regression\
  \ adjusted for demographics were conducted.  Results The study sample consisted\
  \ of predominantly males (82%), non-Kuwaiti (84%), and of young age (42% were 30-39\
  \ years old). The majority of the participants (76%) were currently using the EHR\
  \ system. The physicians' satisfaction with use of EHR system was moderate (Mean:\
  \ 3.47, SD: 0.81, range 1.33-5). The EHR effect on the physicians' work was the\
  \ most significant predictor of satisfaction (β = 0.491, p = 0.000), followed by\
  \ the level of ease (β = 0.274, p = 0.000), and length of use of EHR (β = 0.100,\
  \ p = 0.006). Perceptions of barriers was the strongest predictor of current use\
  \ of EHR (β=-0. 417, p = 0.000), followed by level of ease (β = 0.227, p = 0.000)\
  \ and quality of a related training (β = 0.195, p = 0.000).  Conclusions In the\
  \ promotion of EHR use and related satisfaction, making the use of EHR functions\
  \ (e.g. registration of clinical notes) as easy as possible seems to be a key factor.\
  \ Other factors to consider are removing the barriers physicians face, making the\
  \ benefits of use of EHR visible, and ensuring a high quality related training.\
  \  Key messages Most physicians in a Kuwaiti public hospital use the EHR system.\
  \  Perceived barriers, effect of EHR on the physicians’ work, and user-friendly\
  \ application of EHR are associated with satisfaction and EHR use."
