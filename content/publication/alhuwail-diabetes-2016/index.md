abstract: Today, 415 million adults have diabetes; more than 35 million of diabetic
  adults live in the Middle East and North Africa region. Smartphone penetration in
  the region is high and applications, or apps, for diabetics have shown promising
  results in recent years. This study took place between September and December 2015
  and reviewed all currently available smartphone diabetes apps for Arabic speakers
  in both the Apple App and Google Play stores. There were only few diabetes apps
  for Arabic speakers; only eighteen apps were discovered and considered for this
  study. Most apps were informational. Only three apps offered utilities such as glucose
  reading conversion. The apps had issues related to information quality and adherence
  to latest evidence-based medical advice. There is a need for more evidence-based
  Arabic diabetes apps with improved functionality. Future research of Arabic diabetes
  apps should also focus on the involvement and engagement of the patients in the
  design of these apps.
