 abstract = {Today, 415 million adults have diabetes; more than 35 million of diabetic adults live in the Middle East and North Africa region. Smartphone penetration in the region is high and applications, or apps, for diabetics have shown promising results in recent years. This study took place between September and December 2015 and reviewed all currently available smartphone diabetes apps for Arabic speakers in both the Apple App and Google Play stores. There were only few diabetes apps for Arabic speakers; only eighteen apps were discovered and considered for this study. Most apps were informational. Only three apps offered utilities such as glucose reading conversion. The apps had issues related to information quality and adherence to latest evidence-based medical advice. There is a need for more evidence-based Arabic diabetes apps with improved functionality. Future research of Arabic diabetes apps should also focus on the involvement and engagement of the patients in the design of these apps.},
