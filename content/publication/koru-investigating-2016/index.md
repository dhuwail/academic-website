abstract: "BACKGROUND: As home care utilization increases, information technology\
  \ (IT) becomes a critical tool for providing quality home care. However, most home\
  \ health agencies (HHAs) in the United States are in a position to adopt and leverage\
  \ IT solutions in budget-constrained settings, where it is crucial to address important\
  \ and pressing challenges and opportunities for achieving effectiveness in IT adoption.\
  \ OBJECTIVES: (1) Explore HHAs' challenges and opportunities related to delivering\
  \ home care as well as performing administrative functions and conducting business,\
  \ (2) learn about current IT implementation levels and activities in home care,\
  \ and (3) make recommendations to facilitate efforts and initiatives designed for\
  \ adopting IT in home care effectively. METHODS: Semistructured interviews were\
  \ conducted to elicit rich contextual information from the participants recruited\
  \ from 13 local HHAs in one of the states in the United States. Established systems\
  \ analysis techniques were used to ask questions during the interviews. Framework,\
  \ a qualitative research method, was used to analyze the qualitative data obtained\
  \ from the interviews. RESULTS: Coordinating clinical and administrative workflows\
  \ was an important challenge. Inadequate access to patients' medical history and\
  \ difficulties with medication reconciliation detracted from the quality of care.\
  \ Hiring, training, scheduling, and retaining qualified personnel constituted another\
  \ important challenge. Training and educating patients, caregivers, and families\
  \ hold important opportunities for improving the quality of care. All except one\
  \ HHA adopted electronic health records (EHR) but many continued to struggle considerably\
  \ in their day-to-day functions. Health information exchange (HIE) seems to be the\
  \ most needed technology. Telehealth solutions were perceived to be promising but\
  \ their added value and financial viability in the long run were questioned. CONCLUSIONS:\
  \ The recommendations for effective IT adoption include keeping a quality improvement\
  \ focus, keeping a holistic organizational perspective, considering potential information\
  \ exchange problems, addressing education and training needs, experimentation with\
  \ telehealth if resources permit, considering organization size, and reducing lengthy\
  \ procedures and excessive documentation requirements. The relevant stakeholders,\
  \ such as home care professionals, IT vendors, and policy makers, should consider\
  \ the recommendations from this study to facilitate success in future IT efforts\
  \ and initiatives in home care."
