abstract: Achieving better fall risk management is an integral component of quality
  home care. The current qualitative study uncovers the challenges and opportunities
  of home health agencies (HHAs) in achieving better fall risk management. A secondary
  document analysis was adopted to learn from rich contextual information in fall
  incident reports recorded in a HHA. Poor engagement of patients and caregivers was
  a contributing factor in many fall incidents. Patients often fell as a result of
  not understanding or accepting their physical limitations. For better fall risk
  management, many incidents highlighted a need for providing complete and thorough
  care, better coordination of care, higher levels of sociocultural awareness, patient
  engagement, and caregiver involvement. The results provide evidence regarding the
  challenges and opportunities for improving fall risk management in home care along
  with insight about how information technology solutions can support improvement
  initiatives. [Journal of Gerontological Nursing, 44(7), 15-20.].
