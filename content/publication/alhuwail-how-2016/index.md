abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: From the perspectives of home care patients and caregivers,
  this study aimed to (a) identify the challenges for better fall-risk management
  during home care episodes and (b) explore the opportunities for them to leverage
  health information technology (IT) solutions to improve fall-risk management during
  home care episodes. METHODS: Twelve in-depth semistructured interviews with the
  patients and caregivers were conducted within a descriptive single case study design
  in 1 home health agency (HHA) in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States. RESULTS:
  Patients and caregivers faced challenges to manage fall risks such as unmanaged
  expectations, deteriorating cognitive abilities, and poor care coordination between
  the HHA and physician practices. Opportunities to leverage health IT solutions included
  patient portals, telehealth, and medication reminder apps on smartphones. CONCLUSION:
  Effectively leveraging health IT could further empower patients and caregivers to
  reduce fall risks by acquiring the necessary information and following clinical
  advice and recommendations. The HHAs could improve the quality of care by adopting
  IT solutions that show more promise of improving the experiences of patients and
  caregivers in fall-risk management.'
