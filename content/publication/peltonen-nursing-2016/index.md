abstract: We present one part of the results of an international survey exploring
  current and future nursing informatics (NI) research trends. The study was conducted
  by the International Medical Informatics Association Nursing Informatics Special
  Interest Group (IMIA-NISIG) Student Working Group. Based on findings from this cross-sectional
  study, we identified future NI research priorities. We used snowball sampling technique
  to reach respondents from academia and practice. Data were collected between August
  and September 2015. Altogether, 373 responses from 44 countries were analyzed. The
  identified top ten NI trends were big data science, standardized terminologies (clinical
  evaluation/implementation), education and competencies, clinical decision support,
  mobile health, usability, patient safety, data exchange and interoperability, patient
  engagement, and clinical quality measures. Acknowledging these research priorities
  can enhance successful future development of NI to better support clinicians and
  promote health internationally.
