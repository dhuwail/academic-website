abstract: This study presents a qualitative content analysis of nurses' satisfaction
  and issues with current electronic health record (EHR) systems, as reflected in
  one of the largest international surveys of nursing informatics. Study participants
  from 45 countries (n=469) ranked their satisfaction with the current state of nursing
  functionality in EHRs as relatively low. Two-thirds of the participants (n=283)
  provided disconcerting comments when explaining their low satisfaction rankings.
  More than one half of the comments identified issues at the system level (e.g.,
  poor system usability; non-integrated systems and poor interoperability; lack of
  standards; and limited functionality/missing components), followed by user-task
  issues (e.g., failure of systems to meet nursing clinical needs; non nursing-specific
  systems) and environment issues (e.g., low prevalence of EHRs; lack of user training).
  The study results call for the attention of international stakeholders (educators,
  managers, policy makers) to improve the current issues with EHRs from a nursing
  perspective.
