abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Current advances in information and communication technology
  have made accessing and obtaining health-related information easier than ever before.
  Today, many hospital websites use a patient-centric approach to promote engagement
  and encourage learning for better health-related decision making. However, little
  is known about the current state of hospital websites in the State of Kuwait. This
  study aims to evaluate hospital websites in Kuwait and offer recommendations to
  improve patient engagement and access to health information. METHODS: This study
  employs a cross-sectional analytical approach to evaluate hospital websites in Kuwait
  in 2017. The websites of hospitals that provide in-patient services were identified
  through a structured search. Only active websites that were available in either
  English or Arabic were considered. The evaluation of the websites involved a combination
  of automated and expert- based evaluation methods and was performed across four
  dimensions: Accessibility, Usability, Presence, and Content. RESULTS: Nine hospitals
  met the inclusion criteria. Most of the websites fell short in all four dimensions.
  None of the websites passed the accessibility guidelines. The usability of websites
  varied between hospitals. Overall, the majority of hospitals in Kuwait have rudimentary
  online presence and their websites require careful reassessment with respect to
  design, content, and user experience. The websites focus primarily on promoting
  services provided by the hospital rather than engaging and communicating with patients
  or providing evidence-based information. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare organization and
  website developers should follow best-practices to improve their websites taking
  into consideration the quality, readability, objectivity, coverage and currency
  of the information as well as the design of their websites. Hospitals should leverage
  social media to gain outreach and better engagement with consumers. The websites
  should be offered in additional languages commonly spoken by people living in Kuwait.
  Efforts should be made to ensure that health information on hospital websites are
  evidence-based and checked by healthcare professionals.'
