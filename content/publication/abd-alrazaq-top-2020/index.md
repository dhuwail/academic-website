abstract: "BACKGROUND: The recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is taking\
  \ a toll on the world's health care infrastructure as well as the social, economic,\
  \ and psychological well-being of humanity. Individuals, organizations, and governments\
  \ are using social media to communicate with each other on a number of issues relating\
  \ to the COVID-19 pandemic. Not much is known about the topics being shared on social\
  \ media platforms relating to COVID-19. Analyzing such information can help policy\
  \ makers and health care organizations assess the needs of their stakeholders and\
  \ address them appropriately. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the main topics\
  \ posted by Twitter users related to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Leveraging\
  \ a set of tools (Twitter's search application programming interface (API), Tweepy\
  \ Python library, and PostgreSQL database) and using a set of predefined search\
  \ terms (\\\"corona,\\\" \\\"2019-nCov,\\\" and \\\"COVID-19\\\"), we extracted\
  \ the text and metadata (number of likes and retweets, and user profile information\
  \ including the number of followers) of public English language tweets from February\
  \ 2, 2020, to March 15, 2020. We analyzed the collected tweets using word frequencies\
  \ of single (unigrams) and double words (bigrams). We leveraged latent Dirichlet\
  \ allocation for topic modeling to identify topics discussed in the tweets. We also\
  \ performed sentiment analysis and extracted the mean number of retweets, likes,\
  \ and followers for each topic and calculated the interaction rate per topic. RESULTS:\
  \ Out of approximately 2.8 million tweets included, 167,073 unique tweets from 160,829\
  \ unique users met the inclusion criteria. Our analysis identified 12 topics, which\
  \ were grouped into four main themes: origin of the virus; its sources; its impact\
  \ on people, countries, and the economy; and ways of mitigating the risk of infection.\
  \ The mean sentiment was positive for 10 topics and negative for 2 topics (deaths\
  \ caused by COVID-19 and increased racism). The mean for tweet topics of account\
  \ followers ranged from 2722 (increased racism) to 13,413 (economic losses). The\
  \ highest mean of likes for the tweets was 15.4 (economic loss), while the lowest\
  \ was 3.94 (travel bans and warnings). CONCLUSIONS: Public health crisis response\
  \ activities on the ground and online are becoming increasingly simultaneous and\
  \ intertwined. Social media provides an opportunity to directly communicate health\
  \ information to the public. Health systems should work on building national and\
  \ international disease detection and surveillance systems through monitoring social\
  \ media. There is also a need for a more proactive and agile public health presence\
  \ on social media to combat the spread of fake news."
