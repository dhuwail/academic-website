abstract: 'Nursing informatics (NI) can help provide effective and safe healthcare.
  This study aimed to describe current research trends in NI. In the summer 2015,
  the IMIA-NI Students Working Group created and distributed an online international
  survey of the current NI trends. A total of 402 responses were submitted from 44
  countries. We identified a top five NI research areas: standardized terminologies,
  mobile health, clinical decision support, patient safety and big data research.
  NI research funding was considered to be difficult to acquire by the respondents.
  Overall, current NI research on education, clinical practice, administration and
  theory is still scarce, with theory being the least common. Further research is
  needed to explain the impact of these trends and the needs from clinical practice.'
