abstract: In the United States, home care clinicians often start the episode of care
  devoid of relevant fall-risk information. By collecting and analyzing qualitative
  data from 30 clinicians in one home health agency, this case study aimed to understand
  how the currently adopted information technology solutions supported the clinicians'
  fall-risk management (FRM) information domains, and explored opportunities to adopt
  other solutions to better support FRM. The currently adopted electronic health record
  system and fall-reporting application served only some information domains with
  a limited capacity. Substantial improvement in addressing the FRM information domains
  is possible by effectively modifying the existing solutions and purposefully adopting
  new solutions.
