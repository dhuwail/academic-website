abstract: "OBJECTIVES: To help manage the risk of falls in home care, this study aimed\
  \ to (i) identify home care clinicians' information needs and how they manage missing\
  \ or inaccurate data, (ii) identify problems that impact effectiveness and efficiency\
  \ associated with retaining, exchanging, or processing information about fall risks\
  \ in existing workflows and currently adopted health information technology (IT)\
  \ solutions, and (iii) offer informatics-based recommendations to improve fall risk\
  \ management interventions. METHODS: A case study was carried out in a single not-for-profit\
  \ suburban Medicare-certified home health agency with three branches. Qualitative\
  \ data were collected over a six month period through observations, semi-structured\
  \ interviews, and focus groups. The Framework method was used for analysis. Maximum\
  \ variation sampling was adopted to recruit a diverse sample of clinicians. RESULTS:\
  \ Overall, the information needs for fall risk management were categorized into\
  \ physiological, care delivery, educational, social, environmental, and administrative\
  \ domains. Examples include a brief fall-related patient history, weight-bearing\
  \ status, medications that affect balance, availability of caregivers at home, and\
  \ the influence of patients' cultures on fall management interventions. The unavailability\
  \ and inaccuracy of critical information related to fall risks can delay necessary\
  \ therapeutic services aimed at reducing patients' risk for falling and thereby\
  \ jeopardizing their safety. Currently adopted IT solutions did not adequately accommodate\
  \ data related to fall risk management. CONCLUSION: The results highlight the essential\
  \ information for fall risk management in home care. Home care workflows and health\
  \ IT solutions must effectively and efficiently retain, exchange, and process information\
  \ necessary for fall risk management. Interoperability and integration of the various\
  \ health IT solutions to make data sharing accessible to all clinicians is critical\
  \ for fall risk management. Findings from this study can help home health agencies\
  \ better understand their information needs to manage fall risks."
