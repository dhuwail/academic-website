abstract: 'In the summer of 2015, the International Medical Informatics Association
  Nursing Informatics Special Interest Group (IMIA NISIG) Student Working Group developed
  and distributed an international survey of current and future trends in nursing
  informatics. The survey was developed based on current literature on nursing informatics
  trends and translated into six languages. Respondents were from 31 different countries
  in Asia, Africa, North and Central America, South America, Europe, and Australia.
  This paper presents the results of responses to the survey question: \"What should
  be done (at a country or organizational level) to advance nursing informatics in
  the next 5-10 years?\" (n responders = 272). Using thematic qualitative analysis,
  responses were grouped into five key themes: 1) Education and training; 2) Research;
  3) Practice; 4) Visibility; and 5) Collaboration and integration. We also provide
  actionable recommendations for advancing nursing informatics in the next decade.'
