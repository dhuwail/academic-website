abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Health information technology (IT) solutions can aid healthcare
  reform efforts, but without proper information management, these efforts are futile.
  In this study, we used Kuwait as an example of a high per-capita gross domestic
  product country that faces information management challenges to draw insights that
  can be generalised to other developed countries. OBJECTIVE: (i) to uncover the status
  quo of information management practices in public hospitals and (ii) to offer recommendations
  to improve them. METHOD: This study analysed qualitative and quantitative accreditation-related
  data pertaining to the compliance with the information management standard at all
  secondary care public hospitals over two accreditation cycles. RESULTS: Overall,
  public hospitals had made positive progress in their compliance with the information
  management standard. However, issues still existed with (i) developing and implementing
  an information management plan, (ii) involving the appropriate stakeholders in selecting
  health IT solutions and (iii) access to the Internet by staff and patients. CONCLUSION:
  Evidence underscored the importance of proper information management driven by clear
  centralised strategic plans. IMPLICATIONS: With the rapid adoption of digital health
  systems, the role of health information management leaders should not be undervalued.
  Embracing health IT solutions with strong information management practices can aid
  healthcare reform efforts.'
