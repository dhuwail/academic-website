abstract: "BACKGROUND: The internet and social media have become an important source\
  \ for health information. In 2017, the State of Kuwait ranked first in mobile subscription\
  \ penetration in the Arab world; nearly 90% of its population uses the internet.\
  \ Electronic health (eHealth) literacy is important in populations that have easy\
  \ and affordable access to internet resources to more effectively manage health\
  \ conditions as well as improve general population health. OBJECTIVE: The aim of\
  \ this study was to assess eHealth literacy levels across internet users in Kuwait\
  \ and identify demographic characteristics that influence eHealth literacy. Furthermore,\
  \ the study aimed to identify the reasons and type of information that people seek\
  \ online. Finally, this study examined the utilization of various social media channels\
  \ for accessing online health information. The social media platforms considered\
  \ were as follows: WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, and Snapchat.\
  \ METHODS: A cross-sectional anonymous Web-based survey was used to collect data\
  \ about eHealth literacy and related information. The eHealth literacy scale (eHEALS),\
  \ originally developed by Norman and Skinner, is measured using 8 Likert-type scales.\
  \ A linear regression model estimates the effect of demographic variables such as\
  \ age, gender, and education on eHealth literacy while controlling for participants'\
  \ perceived usefulness and importance of the internet. Participants were also surveyed\
  \ about their frequency in using social media platforms for seeking health information.\
  \ RESULTS: Kuwait's composite eHEALS, based on a sample of 386 participants, was\
  \ 28.63, which is very similar to eHEALS observed among adult populations in other\
  \ developed countries. Females in Kuwait demonstrated a higher average eHEALS compared\
  \ with males. Among the social media platforms, the survey results indicated that\
  \ YouTube is the most frequently used to seek health information, with Facebook\
  \ being the least frequently used. CONCLUSIONS: Internet users in Kuwait appear\
  \ confident in their ability to search for health-related information online compared\
  \ with other populations, as indicated by aggregate eHEALS scores. Considering this\
  \ finding, government and health care organizations should shift more efforts from\
  \ traditional media toward online health information, focusing on the social media\
  \ outlets that people in Kuwait find more useful for seeking health information."
