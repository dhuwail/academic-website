	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Some active video games have been found to promote physical activity  adherence because of enjoyment. However, many active games are exercise themed, which may interfere with the distracting properties that make game-based exercise more enjoyable than traditional exercise. This study compared exercise-themed and game-themed active games to investigate differences in energy expenditure and enjoyment. METHOD: Young adults (N = 100, 50 female, 55 overweight, aged 18-35 years) played two of four Wii Fit games (one aerobic game and one balance game per person) for 10 min each. Of the two aerobic games, one was exercise themed (jogging) and the other was game themed (hula hooping). Both balance games were game themed. Energy expenditure and enjoyment were measured. RESULTS: After adjustment for gender and weight, aerobic games produced 2.70 kcal/kg(-1)/h(-1) (95\% confidence interval 2.41, 3.00) greater energy expenditure than balance games (p {\textless} .001), but balance games were more enjoyable (p {\textless} .001). In aerobic games, jogging produced greater energy expenditure than hula hooping in normal-weight and male participants (p {\textless} .001); in overweight and female participants, no differences were found (p {\textgreater} .17). Hula hooping was enjoyed more  than jogging (p = .008). Enjoyment predicted energy expenditure in aerobic games  (B = 0.767, p = .010). CONCLUSIONS: Aerobic games produced greater energy expenditure but lower enjoyment than balance games, and a game-themed aerobic game was found more enjoyable than an exercise-themed aerobic game. Integrating more strenuous activity into entertaining games instead of games that simply simulate exercise may be a fruitful avenue for active game development.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We performed a pilot study to assess usability and playability of "InsuOnLine," a serious game for education of primary care physicians on insulin  therapy for diabetes mellitus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multidisciplinary team has designed and developed "InsuOnLine," using Andragogy and Problem-Based Learning principles, with game elements to improve players' motivation. The prototype was tested by four medical doctors and two medical students, using the  System Usability Scale (SUS) and a questionnaire to assess playability. These results were used to guide corrections, after which the beta version was retested by 14 medical students and 6 residents. RESULTS: Out of a maximum score of 100 on the SUS, the "InsuOnLine" prototype was rated 88, and some areas for improvement  were identified (game instructions, controls). After corrections, the beta version was rated 92.5 on the SUS. Users have found the beta version to be fun, engaging, challenging, relevant, and realistic. Users said that the game has increased their knowledge on diabetes and insulin, that it has made them feel more confident for prescribing insulin, and that it would have impact on how they treated patients with diabetes. Most users said they have learned more from the game than they would have from a lecture. Lessons learned were the need of early  piloting, preferably by users with very little or very much gaming experience, on their own computers and free patterns of use. CONCLUSIONS: "InsuOnLine" was rated by users as easy to play, fun, and useful for learning. Further studies will assess its educational effectiveness. "InsuOnLine" is a promising tool for large-scale continuing medical education on insulin, helping to fight clinical inertia in diabetes.},

The survey results showed a high percentage of athletes (93.3\%; ) using different dietary supplements throughout the season, 43.8\% () reported using supplements for performance, and 32.6\% () believed in health benefits as a reason for using dietary supplements. Our results showed that a total of 87 (88.7\%), 81 (82.6\%), and 51 (52.0\%) athletes are consuming sports drinks, vitamin C, and multivitamins, respectively. Meanwhile, those supplements ranking among the least used included omega 6 (18.6\%), creatine (16.3\%), and Ginkgo biloba (10.2\%).

This study investigated home care clinicians’ perspectives on (1) how the currently adopted health information technology (IT) solutions supported fall-risk management activities, (2) various shortcomings of these solutions, and (3) ways to improve upon them. Within a case study design, qualitative data were collected through interviews and focus groups at one suburban home health agency in the United States. The clinicians mainly used the electronic health record but experienced substantial difficulties with documenting and accessing fall-related information. Improvement opportunities include providing better workflow support and usability, implementing medication alerts, facilitating fall-related information exchange, and leveraging the IT capabilities at patients’ homes. Additional IT solutions can improve the awareness, assessment, and intervention dimensions of fall-risk management.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate quality of web based information on treatment of depression, to identify potential indicators of content quality, and to establish if accountability criteria are indicators of quality.
Design: Cross sectional survey.
Data sources: 21 frequently accessed websites about depression.
Main outcome measures: (i) Site characteristics; (ii) quality of content—concordance with evidence based depression guidelines (guideline score), appropriateness of other relevant site information (issues score), and subjective rating of site quality (global score); and (iii) accountability—conformity with core accountability standards (Silberg score) and quality of evidence cited in support of conclusions (level of evidence score).
Results: Although the sites contained useful information, their overall quality was poor: the mean guideline, issues, and global scores were only 4.7 (range 0-13) out of 43, 9.8 (6-14) out of 17, and 3 (0.5-7.5) out of 10 respectively. Sites typically did not cite scientific evidence in support of their conclusions. The guideline score correlated with the two other quality of content measures, but none of the content measures correlated with the Silberg accountability score. Content quality was superior for sites owned by organisations and sites with an editorial board.
Conclusions: There is a need for better evidence based information about depression on the web, and a need to reconsider the role of accountability criteria as indicators of site quality and to develop simple valid indicators of quality. Ownership by an organisation and the involvement of a professional editorial board may be useful indicators. The study methodology may be useful for exploring these issues in other health related subjects.},

In this respect it is useful to describe its usage through example. By reference to a recently completed study of IS consultant engagement success factors this paper presents an analysis of the benefits of integrating case study and survey research methods. The emphasis is on the qualitative case study method and how it can complement more quantitative survey research. Benefits are demonstrated through specific examples from the reference study.},

Cross sectional studies are used to determine prevalence. They are relatively quick and easy but do not permit distinction between cause and effect. Case controlled studies compare groups retrospectively. They seek to identify possible predictors of outcome and are useful for studying rare diseases or outcomes.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) increased the roles hospitals and health systems play in care delivery and led to a wave of consolidation of medical groups and hospitals. As such, the traditional patient interaction with an independent medical provider is becoming far less common, replaced by frequent interactions with integrated medical groups and health systems. It is thus increasingly important for these organizations to have an effective social media presence. Moreover, in the age of the informed consumer, patients desire a readily accessible, electronic interface to initiate contact, making a well-designed website and social media strategy critical features of the modern health care organization.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the Web presence of hospitals and their health systems on five dimensions: accessibility, content, marketing, technology, and usability. In addition, an overall ranking was calculated to identify the top 100 hospital and health system websites.
METHODS: A total of 2407 unique Web domains covering 2785 hospital facilities or their parent organizations were identified and matched against the 2009 American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey. This is a four-fold improvement in prior research and represents what the authors believe to be a census assessment of the online presence of US hospitals and their health systems. Each of the five dimensions was investigated with an automated content analysis using a suite of tools. Scores on the dimensions are reported on a range from 0 to 10, with a higher score on any given dimension representing better comparative performance. Rankings on each dimension and an average ranking are provided for the top 100 hospitals.
RESULTS: The mean score on the usability dimension, meant to rate overall website quality, was 5.16 (SD 1.43), with the highest score of 8 shared by only 5 hospitals. Mean scores on other dimensions were between 4.43 (SD 2.19) and 6.49 (SD 0.96). Based on these scores, rank order calculations for the top 100 websites are presented. Additionally, a link to raw data, including AHA ID, is provided to enable researchers and practitioners the ability to further explore relationships to other dynamics in health care.
CONCLUSIONS: This census assessment of US hospitals and their health systems provides a clear indication of the state of the sector. While stakeholder engagement is core to most discussions of the role that hospitals must play in relation to communities, management of an online presence has not been recognized as a core competency fundamental to care delivery. Yet, social media management and network engagement are skills that exist at the confluence of marketing and technical prowess. This paper presents performance guidelines evaluated against best-demonstrated practice or independent standards to facilitate improvement of the sector's use of websites and social media.},

Their prospective health care consumers, who increasingly depend on the Web and social media for communication and consumer engagement, drive this need. As patients and family members navigate the Web presence of hospitals, it is important for these specialized organizations to present themselves and their services efficiently.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the website content of children's hospitals in order to identify opportunities to improve website design and create benchmarks to judge improvement.
METHODS: All websites associated with a children's hospital were identified using a census list of all children's hospitals in the United States. In March of 2014, each website and its social media were evaluated using a Web crawler that provided a 5-dimensional assessment that included website accessibility, marketing, content, technology, and usability. The 5-dimensional assessment was scored on a scale ranging from 0 to 10 with positive findings rated higher on the scale. Websites were ranked by individual dimensions as well as according to their average ranking across all dimensions.
RESULTS: Mean scores of 153 websites ranged from 5.05 to 8.23 across all 5 dimensions. Results revealed that no website scored a perfect 10 on any dimension and that room exists for meaningful improvement.
CONCLUSIONS: Study findings allow for the establishment of baseline benchmarks for tracking future website and social media improvements and display the need for enhanced Web-based consumer engagement for children's hospitals.},

AIM: Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the quality of websites in Tehran's public hospitals.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis involved all public hospitals in Iran's capital city, Tehran, with a working website or subsites between April and June, 2014 (N=59). The websites were evaluated using three validated instruments: a localized checklist, Google page rank, and the Alexa traffic ranking. The mentioned checklist consisted of 112 items divided into five sections: technical characteristics, hospital information and facilities, medical services, interactive on-line services and external activities. Data were analyzed using descriptive and analytical statistics.
RESULTS: The mean website evaluation score was 45.7 out of 224 for selected public hospitals. All the studied websites were in the weak category based on the earned quality scores. There was no statistically significant association between the website evaluation score with Google page rank (P=0.092), Alexa global traffic rank and Alexa traffic rank in Iran (P{\textgreater}0.05). The hospital websites had a lower quality score in the interactive online services and external activities criteria in comparing to other criteria. Due to the low quality level of the studied websites and the importance of hospital portals in providing information and services on the Internet, the authorities should do precise planning for the appreciable improvement in the quality of hospital websites.},

Smartphone penetration in the region is high and applications, or apps, for diabetics have shown promising results in recent years. This study took place between September and December 2015 and reviewed all currently available smartphone diabetes apps for Arabic speakers in both the Apple App and Google Play stores. There were only few diabetes apps for Arabic speakers; only eighteen apps were discovered and considered for this study. Most apps were informational. Only three apps offered utilities such as glucose reading conversion. The apps had issues related to information quality and adherence to latest evidence-based medical advice. There is a need for more evidence-based Arabic diabetes apps with improved functionality. Future research of Arabic diabetes apps should also focus on the involvement and engagement of the patients in the design of these apps.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To help manage the risk of falls in home care, this study aimed to (i) identify home care clinicians' information needs and how they manage missing or inaccurate data, (ii) identify problems that impact effectiveness and efficiency associated with retaining, exchanging, or processing information about fall risks in existing workflows and currently adopted health information technology (IT) solutions, and (iii) offer informatics-based recommendations to improve fall risk management interventions.
METHODS: A case study was carried out in a single not-for-profit suburban Medicare-certified home health agency with three branches. Qualitative data were collected over a six month period through observations, semi-structured interviews, and focus groups. The Framework method was used for analysis. Maximum variation sampling was adopted to recruit a diverse sample of clinicians.
RESULTS: Overall, the information needs for fall risk management were categorized into physiological, care delivery, educational, social, environmental, and administrative domains. Examples include a brief fall-related patient history, weight-bearing status, medications that affect balance, availability of caregivers at home, and the influence of patients' cultures on fall management interventions. The unavailability and inaccuracy of critical information related to fall risks can delay necessary therapeutic services aimed at reducing patients' risk for falling and thereby jeopardizing their safety. Currently adopted IT solutions did not adequately accommodate data related to fall risk management.
CONCLUSION: The results highlight the essential information for fall risk management in home care. Home care workflows and health IT solutions must effectively and efficiently retain, exchange, and process information necessary for fall risk management. Interoperability and integration of the various health IT solutions to make data sharing accessible to all clinicians is critical for fall risk management. Findings from this study can help home health agencies better understand their information needs to manage fall risks.},

	abstract = {Background: Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related death among women worldwide. Herein, we examine global trends in female breast cancer rates using the most up-to-date data available.
Methods: Breast cancer incidence and mortality estimates were obtained from GLOBOCAN 2012 (globocan.iarc.fr). We analyzed trends from 1993 onward using incidence data from 39 countries from the International Agency for Research on Cancer and mortality data from 57 countries from the World Health Organization.
Results: Of 32 countries with incidence and mortality data, rates in the recent period diverged—with incidence increasing and mortality decreasing—in nine countries mainly in Northern/Western Europe. Both incidence and mortality decreased in France, Israel, Italy, Norway, and Spain. In contrast, incidence and death rates both increased in Colombia, Ecuador, and Japan. Death rates also increased in Brazil, Egypt, Guatemala, Kuwait, Mauritius, Mexico, and Moldova.
Conclusions: Breast cancer mortality rates are decreasing in most high-income countries, despite increasing or stable incidence rates. In contrast and of concern are the increasing incidence and mortality rates in a number of countries, particularly those undergoing rapid changes in human development. Wide variations in breast cancer rates and trends reflect differences in patterns of risk factors and access to and availability of early detection and timely treatment.
Impact: Increased awareness about breast cancer and the benefits of early detection and improved access to treatment must be prioritized to successfully implement breast cancer control programs, particularly in transitioning countries.

	abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate themes related to patients' experience in undergoing mammography, as expressed on Twitter.
METHODS: A total of 464 tweets from July to December 2015 containing the hashtag \#mammogram and relating to a patient's experience in undergoing mammography were reviewed.
RESULTS: Of the tweets, 45.5\% occurred before the mammogram compared to 49.6\% that occurred afterward (remainder of tweets indeterminate). However, in patients undergoing their first mammogram, 32.8\% occurred before the examination, whereas in those undergoing follow-up mammogram, 53.0\% occurred before the examination. Identified themes included breast compression (24.4\%), advising other patients to undergo screening (23.9\%), recognition of the health importance of the examination (18.8\%), the act of waiting (10.1\%), relief regarding results (9.7\%), reflection that the examination was not that bad (9.1\%), generalized apprehension regarding the examination (8.2\%), interactions with staff (8.0\%), the gown (5.0\%), examination costs or access (3.4\%), offering or reaching out for online support from other patients (3.2\%), perception of screening as a sign of aging (2.4\%), and the waiting room or waiting room amenities (1.3\%). Of the tweets, 31.9\% contained humor, of which 56.1\% related to compression. Themes that were more common in patients undergoing their first, rather than follow-up, mammogram included breast compression (16.4\% vs 9.1\%, respectively) and that the test was not that bad (26.2\% vs 7.6\%, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Online social media provides a platform for women to share their experiences and reactions in undergoing mammography, including humor, positive reflections, and encouragement of others to undergo the examination. Social media thus warrants further evaluation as a potential tool to help foster greater adherence to screening guidelines.},

Studies have shown that the mass media contain a lot of experiential information (i.e., peer stories) about cancer, either from real individuals or from fictional characters. To date, most studies have focused on using the Internet for peer support. This study aimed to extend this line of research by investigating (1) whether cancer-diagnosed individuals use both television and the Internet to access peer stories, (2) whether exposure to these stories results in different emotional outcomes, and (3) whether this differs depending on gender. A cross-sectional survey among 621 cancer-diagnosed individuals in Flanders (Belgium) showed that both television and the Internet were used as a source for following peer stories. Respondents indicated feeling fearful and concerned when following peer stories on entertainment television, but following peer stories on online forums was associated with feeling supported. These different emotional responses could be the result of the differences between these two content categories (i.e., fictional versus non-fictional peer stories). Future research should further examine these relationships by investigating the role of mass media content and how different psychological coping styles and personality traits moderate these associations.},

The study conducted an online survey of 498 females who followed the Purple Ribbon Twitter campaign (@pprb), a cervical cancer prevention campaign. The results indicated that information acquisition mediated perceived risk's effect on intention. Information acquisition also mediated the relationships between intention and information selection and information transmission. On the other hand, social media-related perceptions indirectly impacted behavioral intention through communicative behaviors. The findings' theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

	abstract = {Purpose
The Korean Society of Coloproctology holds its annual colorectal awareness month every September. This study analyzed the users and the contents of Korean tweets regarding colorectal cancer and estimated the transmissibility of the awareness campaign among Twitter users.

Methods
Prospective data collection was employed to accumulate Korean tweets containing the keywords "colorectal cancer," "colorectal cancer awareness campaign," "gold ribbon," and/or "love handle," from August 1 to September 30, 2014. Twitter users and contents were analyzed, and the credibility of information-sharing tweets throughout the study period was evaluated.

Results
In total, 10,387 tweets shared by 1,452 unique users were analyzed. As for users, 57.8\% were individuals whereas 5.8\% were organizations/communities; spambots accounted for a considerable percentage (36.4\%). As for content, most tweets were spam (n = 8,736, 84.1\%), repetitively advertising unverified commercial folk remedies, followed by tweets that shared information (n = 1,304, 12.6\%) and non-information (n = 347, 3.3\%). In the credibility assessment, only 80.6\% of the information-sharing tweets were medically correct. After spam tweets had been excluded, a significant increase was seen in the percentage of information-sharing tweets (77.1\% to 81.1\%, P = 0.045) during the awareness campaign month.

Conclusion
Most Korean tweets regarding colorectal cancer during the study months were commercial spam tweets; informative public tweets accounted for an extremely small percentage. The transmissibility of the awareness campaign among Twitter users was questionable at best. To expand the reach of credible medical information on colorectal cancer, public health institutions and organizations must pay greater attention to social media.},

	doi = {10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61031-9},
	abstract = {Background
Strong evidence shows that physical inactivity increases the risk of many adverse health conditions, including the world’s major non-communicable diseases (NCDs) of coronary heart disease (CHD), type 2 diabetes, and breast and colon cancers, and shortens life expectancy. Because much of the world’s population is inactive, this presents a major public health problem. We aimed to quantify the impact of physical inactivity on these major NCDs by estimating how much disease could be averted if those inactive were to become active and to estimate gain in life expectancy, at the population level.

Methods
Using conservative assumptions, we calculated population attributable fractions (PAF) associated with physical inactivity for each of the major NCDs, by country, to estimate how much disease could be averted if physical inactivity were eliminated, and used life table analysis to estimate gains in life expectancy of the population.

Findings
Worldwide, we estimate that physical inactivity is responsible for 6\% of the burden of disease from CHD (range: 3.2\% in South-east Asia to 7.8\% in the Eastern Mediterranean region); 7\% of type 2 diabetes (3.9\% to 9.6\%), 10\% of breast cancer (5.6\% to 14.1\%), and 10\% of colon cancer (5.7\% to 13.8\%). Inactivity is responsible for 9\% of premature mortality (5.1\% to 12.5\%), or {\textgreater}5.3 of the 57 million deaths that occurred worldwide in 2008. If inactivity were not eliminated, but decreased instead by 10\% or 25\%, {\textgreater}533,000 and {\textgreater}1.3 million deaths, respectively, may be averted each year. By eliminating physical inactivity, life expectancy of the world’s population is estimated to increase by 0.68 (0.41 to 0.95) years.

Interpretation
Physical inactivity has a major health impact on the world. Elimination of physical inactivity would remove between 6\% and 10\% of the major NCDs of CHD, type 2 diabetes, and breast and colon cancers, and increase life expectancy.},

Any Web site that allows social interaction is considered a social media site, including social networking sites such as Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter; gaming sites and virtual worlds such as Club Penguin, Second Life, and the Sims; video sites such as YouTube; and blogs. Such sites offer today's youth a portal for entertainment and communication and have grown exponentially in recent years. For this reason, it is important that parents become aware of the nature of social media sites, given that not all of them are healthy environments for children and adolescents. Pediatricians are in a unique position to help families understand these sites and to encourage healthy use and urge parents to monitor for potential problems with cyberbullying, “Facebook depression,” sexting, and exposure to inappropriate content.},

	abstract = {Background: Online health information seeking is an activity that needs to be explored in Scotland.  While there are a growing number of studies that adopt a qualitative approach to this issue and attempt to understand the behaviors associated with online health information seeking, previous studies focusing on quantifying the prevalence and pattern of online health seeking in the United Kingdom have been based on Internet users in general. Objective: This exploratory study sought to describe the prevalence of online health information seeking in a rural area of Scotland based on primary data from a patient population. Methods: A survey design was employed utilizing self-completed questionnaires, based on the Pew Internet and American Life Project; questionnaires were distributed among adult patients in 10 primary care centers in a rural community in Scotland. Results: A convenience sample of 571 (0.10\% of the total population in Grampian, N=581,198) patients completed the questionnaire. A total of 68.4\% (379/554) of patients had previously used the Internet to acquire health information. A total of 25.4\% (136/536) of patients consulted the Internet for health information regarding their current appointment on the day surveyed; 34.6\% (47/136) of these patients were influenced to attend their appointment as a result of that online health information.  A total of 43.2\% (207/479) of patients stated the health information helped improve their health and 67.1\% (290/432) indicated that they had learned something new.  A total of 34.0\% (146/430) of patients talked to a health professional about the information they had found and 90.0\% (376/418) reported that the information was useful.
In total, 70.4\% (145/206) of patients were concerned about obtaining health information online from reliable sources. A total of 67.1\% (139/207) of patients were concerned that a health site may sell their personal information, yet only 6.7\% (36/535) checked the privacy policy of the site visited.  However, 27.9\% (55/197) of patients were not concerned about their employer finding out what health sites they visited, whereas 37.5\% (78/208) were concerned that others would find out. Conclusions: The results suggest that online health information-seeking behavior influences offline health-related behavior among the population surveyed.  Patient attitudes to online health information seeking were focused on issues relating to trust, reliability, privacy, and confidentiality.  This study provides support for the growing phenomenon of an empowered, computer-literate, health information consumer, and the impact of this phenomenon must be considered in the context of the patient-health professional dynamic.  The unpredictable nature of human thought and action in relation to this field of study requires an ongoing program of ethnographic research, both physical and virtual, within a Health Web Science framework.  This study has provided a baseline of the prevalence of online health information seeking in the Grampian region of Scotland.  [JMIR Res Protoc 2015;4(3):e85]},

Twenty adolescents 14 to 18 years old with type 1 diabetes were asked to use Instagram to post any diabetes-related photo for 3 weeks. Individual interviews and a focus group were also offered, and recruitment and retention statistics were tracked. Of those approached (n = 47), 43\% agreed to participate. Twelve were actively engaged. Shared photos were most likely to fall into the categories of diabetes care, humor, or food.

	doi = {10.4338/ACI-2015-11-RA-0160},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To help manage the risk of falls in home care, this study aimed to (i) identify home care clinicians' information needs and how they manage missing or inaccurate data, (ii) identify problems that impact effectiveness and efficiency associated with retaining, exchanging, or processing information about fall risks in existing workflows and currently adopted health information technology (IT) solutions, and (iii) offer informatics-based recommendations to improve fall risk management interventions.
METHODS: A case study was carried out in a single not-for-profit suburban Medicare-certified home health agency with three branches. Qualitative data were collected over a six month period through observations, semi-structured interviews, and focus groups. The Framework method was used for analysis. Maximum variation sampling was adopted to recruit a diverse sample of clinicians.
RESULTS: Overall, the information needs for fall risk management were categorized into physiological, care delivery, educational, social, environmental, and administrative domains. Examples include a brief fall-related patient history, weight-bearing status, medications that affect balance, availability of caregivers at home, and the influence of patients' cultures on fall management interventions. The unavailability and inaccuracy of critical information related to fall risks can delay necessary therapeutic services aimed at reducing patients' risk for falling and thereby jeopardizing their safety. Currently adopted IT solutions did not adequately accommodate data related to fall risk management.
CONCLUSION: The results highlight the essential information for fall risk management in home care. Home care workflows and health IT solutions must effectively and efficiently retain, exchange, and process information necessary for fall risk management. Interoperability and integration of the various health IT solutions to make data sharing accessible to all clinicians is critical for fall risk management. Findings from this study can help home health agencies better understand their information needs to manage fall risks.},

The main outcome measures included the ability of patients to access the Internet, their ability to use the Internet to search for health-related information, and their responses to Internet searches in relation to their self-care activities. Further analysis of differences based on age, gender, sociodemographic, and diabetes-related self-care activities among online health-related information seekers and nononline health-related information seekers was conducted. Results: Among the 344 patients, 74.1\% (255/344) were male with a mean age of 53.5 (SD 13.8) years. Only 39.0\% (134/344) were Internet users; 71.6\% (96/134) of them used the Internet for seeking health-related information. Most participants reported that their primary source of health-related information was their physician (216/344, 62.8\%) followed by television (155/344, 45.1\%), family (113/344, 32.8\%), newspapers (100/344, 29.1\%), and the Internet (96/344, 27.9\%).

	abstract = {Context We present the development and evaluation of WhatsApp messaging to improve engagement adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus at a District General Hospital in West London District.
Problem Adolescence is a particularly challenging time where metabolic control often deteriorates. Many adolescents find diabetes socially isolating. Engagement and compliance are challenging issues and traditional healthcare models don’t always seem relevant to this population. This issue was highlighted when a patient was admitted to resus with severe diabetic keto-acidosis who was text-messaging on her mobile phone and disclosed she missed her last clinic appointment. The way patients are accessing health information is changing. Social media is a rapidly expanding and under-utilised resource. Now more people world-wide have access to mobile phones than tooth-brushes.
Intervention and assessment of problem The concept of a WhatsApp broadcast was developed. This virtual community allows information to be disseminated quickly to a large group of patients without individuals feeling singled out. The group allows patients to share information and expertise in self-management, ask questions and form relationships with peers, with the aim of bridging gaps between appointments and improving motivation and self-management. Patients participated in the design process through a co-production session using a graphic facilitator to stimulate strategic dialogue. Co-production is where health-care providers and service users work together to identify problems and solutions to improve their care. The session was attended by 6 patients and 4 staff members. Patients believed this concept would improve patient motivation.
Design All children with type 1 diabetes aged 11 years or greater were invited to participate in the WhatsApp group from March 2015. Twenty patients and 4 staff are now members. Informed consent was obtained from children and parents. Patient safety is maintained as the group is a ‘broadcast’ rather than an ‘open group,’ therefore replies are directed to the diabetic team phone, who have to approve messages sent ensuring quality control.
Measurement of improvement and outcomes Qualitative and quantitative data was collected to assess patient experience. Feedback was overwhelmingly positive. Patients send messages to the group, such as ‘snack advice.’ They write questions and send pictures for their peers. ‘Patient user’ sent messages increased from 7 messages in April to 88 messages in August 2015 demonstrating increasing user engagement. Qualitative data was obtained from patients and parents using questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. Recurring themes highlighted on thematic analysis included improved access to information and the benefits of talking to others with diabetes. One mother quoted ‘This is what my son needs, he knows no one with diabetes and often feels he is the only one who has to inject then acts out.’ A patient quoted ‘I find it easier to ask questions on the WhatsApp group [compared to clinic].’ All (100\%) of survey responders felt that their access to information had improved since joining the WhatsApp group and that they had learnt something new. Sixty seven percent of patients felt more motivated since they joined the group. HbA1c data was also reviewed pre and post intervention. The mean HbA1c changed from 9.7 to 9\%. The Median HbA1c changed from 9.8 to 7.9\%. There was no change in missed clinic appointment rates, however the two patients who most frequently did not attend clinic were amongst the highest WhatsApp users, one had a significant improvement in HbA1c. This could indicate that this tool could be useful for targeting those who are particularly difficult to engage.
Conclusion Digital strategies can easily be adopted into Diabetes care. This innovative approach highlights the successful use of technology to improve patient engagement and access to information. This model may be particularly useful at targeting those who are difficult to engage (Figure 1).

Health information obtained from the Internet has an impact on patient health care outcomes. There is a growing concern over the quality of online health information sources used by diabetic patients because little is known about their health information–seeking behavior and the impact this behavior has on their diabetes-related self-care, in particular in the Middle East setting.

Objective
The aim of this study was to determine the online health-related information–seeking behavior among adult type 2 diabetic patients in the Middle East and the impact of their online health-related information–seeking behavior on their self-care activities.

With the worldwide population growing in age, information technology may help meet important needs to prepare and support patients and families for aging. We sought to explore the use and acceptance of information technology for health among the elderly by reviewing the existing literature.
Methods
Review of literature using PubMed and Google Scholar, references from relevant papers, and consultation with experts.
Results
Elderly people approach the Internet and health information technology differently than younger people, but have growing rates of adoption. Assistive technology, such as sensors or home monitors, may help ‘aging in place’, but these have not been thoroughly evaluated. Elders face many barriers in using technology for healthcare decision-making, including issues with familiarity, willingness to ask for help, trust of the technology, privacy, and design challenges.
Conclusions
Barriers must be addressed for these tools to be available to this growing population. Design, education, research, and policy all play roles in addressing these barriers to acceptance and use.},

	doi = {10.1001/jamainternmed.2015.2903},
	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Elderly patients often share control of their personal health information and decision making with family and friends when needed. Patient portals can help with information sharing, but concerns about privacy and autonomy of elderly patients remain. Health systems that implement patient portals would benefit from guidance about how best to implement access to portals for caregivers of elderly patients.
OBJECTIVE: To identify how patients older than 75 years (hereinafter, elders) and family caregivers of such patients approach sharing of health information, with the hope of applying the results to collaborative patient portals.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A qualitative study was conducted from October 20, 2013, to February 16, 2014, inviting participants older than 75 years (n = 30) and participants who assist a family member older than 75 years (n = 23) to 1 of 10 discussion groups. Participants were drawn from the Information Sharing Across Generations (InfoSAGE) Living Laboratory, an ongoing study of information needs of elders and families based within an academically affiliated network of senior housing in metropolitan Boston, Massachusetts. Groups were separated into elders and caregivers to allow for more detailed discussion. A professional moderator led groups using a discussion guide. Group discussions were audiotaped, transcribed, and analyzed inductively using immersion/crystallization methods for central themes.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Central themes regarding sharing of health information between elderly patients and family caregivers.
RESULTS: Seven lessons emerged from 2 main themes. First, sharing information has consequences: (1) elders and caregivers have different perspectives on what is seen as the "burden" of information, (2) access to medical information by families can have unintended consequences, and (3) elders do not want to feel "spied on" by family. Second, control of information sharing is dynamic: (4) elders wish to retain control of decision making as long as possible, (5) transfer of control occurs gradually depending on elders' health and functional status, (6) control of information sharing and decision making should be fluid to maximize elders' autonomy, and (7) no "one-size-fits-all" approach can satisfy individuals' different preferences.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Information sharing and control are complex issues even under the most well-meaning circumstances. While elders may delegate control and share information with family, they want to retain granular control of their information. When using patient portals, simple proxy access may not adequately address the needs and concerns of aging patients.},

Increasing amounts of resources are being devoted to these interventions, but do they ensure or improve quality of care? There is little research evidence as to their effectiveness or the conditions for maximum effectiveness. Reasons for the lack of evaluation research include the methodological challenges of measuring outcomes and attributing causality to these complex, changing, long term social interventions to organisations or health systems, which themselves are complex and changing. However, methods are available which can be used to evaluate these programmes and which can provide decision makers with research based guidance on how to plan and implement them. This paper describes the research challenges, the methods which can be used, and gives examples and guidance for future research. It emphasises the important contribution which such research can make to improving the effectiveness of these programmes and to developing the science of quality improvement.},

	abstract = {Objective
Development of a good practice guideline to plan and perform scientifically robust evaluation studies in health informatics.
Methods
Issues to be addressed in evaluation studies were identified and guidance drafted based on the evaluation literature and on experiences by key players. Successive drafts of the guideline were discussed in several rounds by an increasing number of experts during conferences and by e-mail. At a fairly early point the guideline was put up for comments on the web.
Results
Sixty issues were identified that are of potential relevance for planning, implementation and execution of an evaluation study in the health informatics domain. These issues cover all phases of an evaluation study: Preliminary outline, study design, operationalization of methods, project planning, execution and completion of the evaluation study. Issues of risk management and project control as well as reporting and publication of the evaluation results are also addressed.
Conclusion
A comprehensive list of issues is presented as a guideline for good evaluation practice in health informatics (GEP-HI). The strengths and weaknesses of the guideline are discussed. Application of this guideline will support better handling of an evaluation study, potentially leading to a higher quality of evaluation studies. This guideline is an important step towards building stronger evidence and thus to progress towards evidence-based health informatics.},

	abstract = {A review of evaluation literature concerning CDSSs indicates that randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) are the ‘gold standard’ for evaluation. While this approach is excellent for studying system or clinical performance, it is not well suited to answering questions concerning whether systems will be used or how they will be used. Because lack of use of CDSS has been of concern for some years, other evaluation research designs are needed to address those issues. This paper critiques RCT and experimental evaluation approaches and presents alternative approaches to evaluation that address questions outside the scope of the usual RCT and experimental designs. A wide range of literature is summarized to illustrate the value of evaluations that take into account social, organizational, professional, and other contextual considerations. Many of these studies go beyond the usual measures of systems performance or physicians’ behavior by focusing on ‘fit’ of the system with other aspects of professional and organizational life. Because there is little explicit theory that informs many evaluations, the paper then reviews CDSS evaluations informed by social science theories. Lastly, it proposes a theoretical social science base of social interactionism. An example of such an approach is given. It involves a CDSS in psychiatry and is based on Kaplan's 4Cs, which focus on communication, control, care, and context. Although the example is a CDSS, the evaluation approach also is useful for clinical guideline implementation and other medical informatics applications. Similarly, although the discussion is about social interactionism, the more important point is the need to broaden evaluation through a variety of methods and approaches that investigate social, cultural, organizational, cognitive, and other contextual concerns. Methodological pluralism and a variety of research questions can increase understanding of many influences concerning informatics applications development and deployment.},

	abstract = {Innovations in health care are often characterized by complexity and fuzzy boundaries, involving both the elements of the innovation and the organizational structure required for a full implementation. Evaluation in health care is traditionally based on the collection and dissemination of evidence-based knowledge stating the randomized controlled trial, and the quasi-experimental study design as the most rigorous and ideal approaches. These evaluation approaches capture neither the complexity of innovations in health care, nor the characteristics of the organizational structure of the innovation. As a result, the reasons for innovations in health care not being disseminated are not fully explained. The aim of the paper is to present a design - evaluation framework for complex innovations in health care in order to understand what works for whom under what circumstances by combining design theory and realist evaluation. The framework is based on research findings of a case study of a complex innovation, a health care quality register, in order to understand underlying assumptions behind the design of the innovation, as well as the characteristics of the implementation process. The design - evaluation cycle is hypothesized to improve the design and implementation of complex innovation by using program/kernel theories to develop design propositions, which are evaluated by realistic evaluation, resulting in further refinement of program/kernel theories. The goal of the design - evaluation cycle is to provide support to implementers and practitioners in designing and implementing complex innovations in health care. As a result, the design - evaluation cycle could provide opportunities of improving dissemination of complex innovations in health care.},

	abstract = {Although innovation diffusion is a central topic in policy and strategy, its measurement remains difficult – particularly in cases where the innovation is a complex and possibly ambiguous practice. In this paper, we develop four theoretical mechanisms that may bias diffusion markers by leading to the understatement and/or overstatement of diffusion at different points in time. Employing the case of “green chemistry,” we then compare three different diffusion markers – keywords, database index terms, and domain expert assessments – and we demonstrate how they lead to differing conclusions about the magnitude and timing of diffusion, organizational demography, publication outlets, and collaboration. We also provide suggestive evidence of extensive “greenwashing” by particular organization types and in particular countries. Building on these findings, we point to potential challenges with existing diffusion studies, and we make a case for the incorporation of practitioners in construct measurement and for the integration of comparative metrics in diffusion studies.},

	abstract = {Once a health promotion program has proven to be effective in one or two initial settings, attempts may be made to transfer the program to new settings. One way to conceptualize the transference of health promotion programs from one locale to another is by considering the programs to be innovations that are being diffused. In this way, diffusion of innovation theory can be applied to guide the process of program transference. This article reports on the development of six questionnaires to measure the extent to which health promotion programs are successfully disseminated: Organizational Climate, Awareness-Concern, Rogers's Adoption Variables, Level of Use, Level of Success, and Level of Institutionalization. The instruments are being successfully used in a study of the diffusion of health promotion/tobacco prevention curricula to junior high schools in North Carolina. The instruments, which measure the four steps of the diffusion process, have construct validity since they were developed within existing theories and are derived from the work of previous researchers. No previous research has attempted to use instruments like these to measure sequentially the stages of the diffusion process.},

In developing this scale, the authors drew from theory, previously validated measures, expert review and pre-testing with SDFS coordinators. Factor analysis revealed three underlying constructs representing relative advantage/compatibility, complexity and observability. The constructs found were internally consistent with a Cronbach's α ranging from a high of 0.89 for relative advantage/compatibility to a low of 0.71 for observability. Each of these constructs was correlated with a district's adoption of the policy in predictable ways. The construct of relative advantage/compatibility appears to be especially useful in assessing policy adoption. This scale was developed to assess a specific innovation; however, we believe that it can be easily adapted to understand the adoption of other health education interventions.},

Our analysis demonstrates a diverse range of vendors’ UCD practices that fall into 3 categories: well-developed UCD, basic UCD, and misconceptions of UCD. Specific challenges to practicing UCD include conducting contextually rich studies of clinical workflow, recruiting participants for usability studies, and having support from leadership within the vendor organization.

	abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of this article is to describe perspectives on information availability and information use among users of a management information system in one specialized health care organization. The management information system (MIS) is defined as the information system that provides management with information about financial and operational aspects of hospital management.
Methods
The material for this qualitative case study was gathered by semi-structured interviews. The interviewees were purposefully selected from one specialized health care organization. The organization has developed its management information system in recent years. Altogether 13 front-line, middle and top-level managers were interviewed. The two themes discussed were information availability and information use. The data were analyzed using inductive content analysis using ATLAS.ti computer program.
Results
The main category “usage of management information system” consisted of four sub-categories: (1) system quality, (2) information quality, (3) use and user satisfaction and (4) development of information culture.
Conclusions
There were many organizational and cultural aspects which influence the use of MIS in addition to factors concerning system usability and users. The connection between information culture and information use was recognized and the managers proposed numerous ways to increase the use of information in management work. The implementation and use of management information system did not seem to be planned as an essential tool in strategic information management in the health care organization studied.},

The purpose of this paper is to review and categorize health IT usability study methods and to provide practical guidance on health IT usability evaluation. 2025 references were initially retrieved from the Medline database from 2003 to 2009 that evaluated health IT used by clinicians. Titles and abstracts were first reviewed for inclusion. Full-text articles were then examined to identify final eligibility studies. 629 studies were categorized into the five stages of an integrated usability specification and evaluation framework that was based on a usability model and the system development life cycle (SDLC)-associated stages of evaluation. Theoretical and methodological aspects of 319 studies were extracted in greater detail and studies that focused on system validation (SDLC stage 2) were not assessed further. The number of studies by stage was: stage 1, task-based or user–task interaction, n=42; stage 2, system–task interaction, n=310; stage 3, user–task–system interaction, n=69; stage 4, user–task–system–environment interaction, n=54; and stage 5, user–task–system–environment interaction in routine use, n=199. The studies applied a variety of quantitative and qualitative approaches. Methodological issues included lack of theoretical framework/model, lack of details regarding qualitative study approaches, single evaluation focus, environmental factors not evaluated in the early stages, and guideline adherence as the primary outcome for decision support system evaluations. Based on the findings, a three-level stratified view of health IT usability evaluation is proposed and methodological guidance is offered based upon the type of interaction that is of primary interest in the evaluation.},

	abstract = {Evidence is emerging that certain technologies such as computerized provider order entry may reduce the likelihood of patient harm. However, many technologies that should reduce medical errors have been abandoned because of problems with their design, their impact on workflow, and general dissatisfaction with them by end users. Patient safety researchers have therefore looked to human factors engineering for guidance on how to design technologies to be usable (easy to use) and useful (improving job performance, efficiency, and/or quality). While this is a necessary step towards improving the likelihood of end user satisfaction, it is still not sufficient. Human factors engineering research has shown that the manner in which technologies are implemented also needs to be designed carefully if benefits are to be realized. This paper reviews the theoretical knowledge on what leads to successful technology implementation and how this can be translated into specifically designed processes for successful technology change. The literature on diffusion of innovations, technology acceptance, organisational justice, participative decision making, and organisational change is reviewed and strategies for promoting successful implementation are provided. Given the rapid and ever increasing pace of technology implementation in health care, it is critical for the science of technology implementation to be understood and incorporated into efforts to improve patient safety.},

This demand requires an adequate evaluation of these systems. A wide variety of approaches and methodologies have been applied in assessing the impact of information systems in health care, ranging from controlled clinical trials to use of questionnaires and interviews with users. In this paper we describe methodological approaches which we have applied and refined for the past 10 years for the evaluation of health information systems. The approaches are strongly rooted in theories and methods from cognitive science and the emerging field of usability engineering. The focus is on assessing human computer interaction and in particular, the usability of computer systems in both laboratory and naturalistic settings. The methods described can be a part of the formative evaluation of systems during their iterative development, and can also complement more traditional assessment methods used in summative system evaluation of completed systems. The paper provides a review of the general area of systems evaluation with the motivation and rationale for methodological approaches underlying usability engineering and cognitive task analysis as applied to health information systems. This is followed by a detailed description of the methods we have applied in a variety of settings in conducting usability testing and usability inspection of systems such as computer-based patient records. Emerging trends in the evaluation of complex information systems are discussed.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE—A computer based touchscreen family cancer history questionnaire was developed and implemented to facilitate the provision of cancer risk assessments for the ambulatory and outpatient populations of a free standing cancer hospital.
METHODS—A questionnaire consisting of a series of branched point decision making screens was developed which enables the participant to enter demographic data, personal cancer history, and cancer histories for first and second degree relatives. A freestanding touchscreen computer kiosk system was used to place the questionnaire in public areas of the cancer hospital and clinic. Genetic professionals analysed the data received, using published criteria, and provided a basic cancer risk assessment and surveillance recommendations within 10 business days. A survey was completed by a small random group of users (n=59) three to six months after receipt of their risk assessment. 
RESULTS—After 11 months, 1440 people had entered information and received a written communication. Only 2\% of completed questionnaires contained insufficient information to provide a basic risk assessment. Of the small group of participants surveyed, almost all (95\%) felt "very comfortable" using the system, 93\% remembered receiving the risk assessment letter when queried three to six months later, 42\% felt their perceptions about cancer risk had changed, and 20\% had made changes in their or their family's cancer surveillance practices. 
CONCLUSION—The touchscreen computer family history questionnaire allows easy collection of family history information, provision of risk assessments to a broad population, and promotes increased awareness of familial risk and appropriate surveillance.

	abstract = {The Transfusion Medicine Service (TMS) covers diverse clinical and laboratory-based services that must be delivered with accuracy, efficiency and reliability. TMS oversight is shared by multiple regulatory agencies that cover product manufacturing and validation standards geared toward patient safety. These demands present significant informatics challenges. Over the past few decades, TMS information systems have improved to better handle blood product manufacturing, inventory, delivery, tracking and documentation. Audit trails and access to electronic databases have greatly facilitated product traceability and biovigilance efforts. Modern blood bank computing has enabled novel applications such as the electronic crossmatch, kiosk-based blood product delivery systems, and self-administered computerized blood donor interview and eligibility determination. With increasing use of barcoding technology, there has been a marked improvement in patient and specimen identification. Moreover, the emergence of national and international labeling standards such as ISBT 128 have facilitated the availability, movement and tracking of blood products across national and international boundaries. TMS has only recently begun to leverage the electronic medical record to address quality issues in transfusion practice and promote standardized documentation within institutions. With improved technology, future growth is expected in blood bank automation and product labeling with applications such as radio frequency identification devices. This article reviews several of these key informatics issues relevant to the contemporary practice of TMS.},

The utility of parents' report of medication data via a multimedia, touch screen interface, the asthma kiosk, was investigated. Our specific aims were (1) to estimate the validity of parents' electronically entered medication history for asthma and (2) to compare the parents' kiosk entries regarding medications to the documentation of ED physicians and nurses., Methods: We enrolled a cohort of parents to use the asthma kiosk and tested the validity of this communication channel for medication data specific to pediatric asthma. Parents' data provided via the kiosk during the ED encounter and the documentation of ED nurses and physicians were compared with a telephone-based interview with the parent after discharge that reviewed all asthma-specific medications physically present in the home. Treating clinicians in the ED were blinded to the parents' kiosk entries., Results: Sixty-six parents were enrolled and 49 of 66 (74.2\%) completed the gold standard interview. When analyzed at the level of individual medications, the validity of parental report was 81\% for medication name, 79\% for route of delivery, 66\% for the form of the medication, and 60\% for dose. Parents' report improved on the validity of documentation by physicians across all medication details save for medication name. Parents' report was more valid than nursing documentation at triage for all medication details., Conclusion: Parents can provide an independent source of medication data that improves on current documentation for key variables that impact quality and safety in emergency asthma care.},

	abstract = {Background
High levels of adherence to medications for HIV infection are essential for optimal clinical outcomes and to reduce viral transmission, but many patients do not achieve required levels. Clinician-delivered interventions can improve patients’ adherence, but usually require substantial effort by trained individuals and may not be widely available. Computer-delivered interventions can address this problem by reducing required staff time for delivery and by making the interventions widely available via the Internet. We previously developed a computer-delivered intervention designed to improve patients’ level of health literacy as a strategy to improve their HIV medication adherence. The intervention was shown to increase patients’ adherence, but it was not clear that the benefits resulting from the increase in adherence could justify the costs of developing and deploying the intervention. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relation of development and deployment costs to the effectiveness of the intervention.

Methods
Costs of intervention development were drawn from accounting reports for the grant under which its development was supported, adjusted for costs primarily resulting from the project’s research purpose. Effectiveness of the intervention was drawn from results of the parent study. The relation of the intervention’s effects to changes in health status, expressed as utilities, was also evaluated in order to assess the net cost of the intervention in terms of quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Sensitivity analyses evaluated ranges of possible intervention effectiveness and durations of its effects, and costs were evaluated over several deployment scenarios.

Results
The intervention’s cost effectiveness depends largely on the number of persons using it and the duration of its effectiveness. Even with modest effects for a small number of patients the intervention was associated with net cost savings in some scenarios and for durations greater than three months and longer it was usually associated with a favorable cost per QALY. For intermediate and larger assumed effects and longer durations of intervention effectiveness, the intervention was associated with net cost savings.

Conclusions
Computer-delivered adherence interventions may be a cost-effective strategy to improve adherence in persons treated for HIV.

The formative evaluation of the asthma kiosk demonstrates its ability to capture patient-specific data during real-time care in the emergency department (ED) with a mean completion time of 11 minutes.

	abstract = {Background
Interactive behavior change technology (eg, computer programs, Internet websites, and mobile phones) may facilitate the implementation of lifestyle behavior interventions in routine primary health care. Effective, fully automated solutions not involving primary health care staff may offer low-cost support for behavior change.

Objectives
We explored the effectiveness of an electronic screening and brief intervention (e-SBI) deployed through a stand-alone information kiosk for promoting physical activity among sedentary patients in routine primary health care. We further tested whether its effectiveness differed between patients performing the e-SBI on their own initiative and those referred to it by primary health care staff.

Methods
The e-SBI screens for the physical activity level, motivation to change, attitudes toward performing the test, and physical characteristics and provides tailored feedback supporting behavior change. A total of 7863 patients performed the e-SBI from 2007 through 2009 in routine primary health care in Östergötland County, Sweden. Of these, 2509 were considered not sufficiently physically active, and 311 of these 2509 patients agreed to participate in an optional 3-month follow-up. These 311 patients were included in the analysis and were further divided into two groups based on whether the e-SBI was performed on the patient´s own initiative (informed by posters in the waiting room) or if the patient was referred to it by staff. A physical activity score representing the number of days being physically active was compared between baseline e-SBI and the 3-month follow-up. Based on physical activity recommendations, a score of 5 was considered the cutoff for being sufficiently physically active.

Results
In all, 137 of 311 patients (44\%) were sufficiently physically active at the 3-month follow-up. The proportion becoming sufficiently physically active was 16/55 (29\%), 40/101 (40\%), and 81/155 (52\%) for patients with a physical activity score at baseline of 0, 1 to 2, and 3 to 4, respectively. The patient-initiated group and staff-referred group had similar mean physical activity scores at baseline (2.1, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.8-2.3, versus 2.3, 95\% CI 2.1-2.5) and at follow-up, (4.1, 95\% CI 3.4-4.7, vs 4.2, 95\% CI 3.7-4.8).

Conclusions
Among the sedentary patients in primary health care who participated in the follow-up, the e-SBI appeared effective at promoting short-term improvement of physical activity for about half of them. The results were similar when the e-SBI was patient-initiated or staff-referred. The e-SBI may be a low-cost complement to lifestyle behavior interventions in routine primary health care and could work as a stand-alone technique not requiring the involvment of primary health care staff.},

Even if medical facilities are available in urban areas, due to lack of time due to work schedule, time taken to go in for this comprehensive procedures of getting appointment and spending a whole day in the labs for screening are a woeful experience for many and in some cases, the elderly people may have no one to take them to the hospital for screening. We propose a medical network based on state-of-the-art medical kiosk that addresses the problems of providing preventive and diagnostic healthcare. This paper presents a web-centric diabetic expert system kiosk that is similar to a bank ATM.},

	abstract = {Making healthcare services easily accessible to the world population requires a huge skilled workforce along with massive investment in equipments for medical testing and monitoring. Due to the limited capital in developing countries and scarcity of skilled workforce, the problem is getting worse day by day. A fusion of technologies - vital signs monitoring and e-health based prescriptive diagnosis can provide an efficient and pervasive healthcare solution to address this problem. We propose the technology and its commercial application for providing such diagnostic health-care services, which could in time become as popular and pervasive as ATMs are today for financial activities. VSM technology is maturing with many companies integrating health sensors, while Web-based self help sites are becoming popular with sites like webmd.com being used with high degree of confidence by patients and practitioners alike. In our offering, we propose a kiosk like structure, where the vital signs of a patient are measured on the front-end; and with the data collected, a backend database (offline or tele-based) gives on-the-spot diagnosis. The user who already has logged in (like an ATM) is given his summary report, with either a preliminary solution or recommended to nearest specialty hospitals, and his record is updated with the new diagnosis and recommendations. The underlying business model is based on both service and advertising mode. For the sensing devices, the cost is extracted from the customer (minimal), while for the kiosk and display setup, the hospitals or Websites which are further recommended can pay in the form of advertisement revenue.},

A cited reference search of articles meeting the inclusion criteria was also conducted to reduce misses. Fifty-two articles met the selection criteria. Among them, 94 different variables were tested for associations with acceptance. Most of those tested (71\%) were patient factors, including sociodemographic characteristics, health- and treatment-related variables, and prior experience or exposure to computer/health technology. Only ten variables were related to human-technology interaction; 16 were organizational factors; and one was related to the environment. In total, 62 (66\%) were found to predict acceptance in at least one study. Existing literature focused largely on patient-related factors. No studies examined the impact of social and task factors on acceptance, and few tested the effects of organizational or environmental factors on acceptance. Future research guided by technology acceptance theories should fill those gaps to improve our understanding of patient CHIT acceptance, which in turn could lead to better CHIT design and implementation.},

The formative evaluation of the asthma kiosk demonstrates its ability to capture patient-specific data during real-time care in the emergency department (ED) with a mean completion time of 11 minutes. The asthma kiosk successfully links parents' data to guideline recommendations and identifies data critical to health improvements for asthmatic children that otherwise remains undocumented during ED-based care.},

METHODS: Interactive kiosks in waiting rooms of clinics for the medically underserved were used to educate patients about alcohol consumption, exercise, smoking cessation, and weight control.
RESULTS: Kiosks were accessed 11,401 times. Users averaged 40 years old, and most had at least a high school education and an average body mass index (BMI) of 29.8. Sixty percent were white, and 64\% were women. Weight control garnered the most interest followed by smoking cessation. Those overweight and men with sleep disorders were more interested in weight control. Smokers and depressed women were most interested in smoking cessation. Men who were older, Latino, or had high blood pressure and women who were overweight were most interested in exercise. Those interested most in alcohol consumption were men who were white, drink alcohol, or married and women who were younger, single, black, Latino, or smoke.
CONCLUSIONS: These results add to our understanding of underserved populations and individuals who might be more receptive to preventive health interventions so that educational efforts might be more likely to result in behavior change.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Engaging patients in their healthcare is a goal of healthcare reform. Obtaining sufficient, reliable patient feedback about their experiences in an office encounter has been a challenge.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility of collecting feedback from patients regarding their office encounter at the point of care using touch screen kiosk technology in an urban primary care clinic. Methods: We analyzed response rate, ease of use, provider data, and condition-specific data. The study was conducted over a 45-day period at 1 internal medicine academic teaching practice. Providers, staff, and a sponsor-supported monitor directed patients to use the kiosk after an office visit.
RESULTS: A total of 1923 surveys were completed from 3850 office visits (50\%). There was no appreciable impact on office flow in terms of wait time, checkout procedures, or visit with provider. Characteristics of patients completing the surveys were similar to practice demographics of patients with an office visit during the study period in terms of sex, but differed by age and race. Small but statistically significant differences were seen among patient ratings of resident versus attending physicians. Patients with depression were less likely than patients with diabetes, chronic low back pain, or asthma to report that they had set personal goals to manage their condition.
CONCLUSION: This technology represents an important advance in our ability to capture the patient's opinion regarding quality and practice improvement initiatives, and has the potential for directly engaging patients in their care.},

There were significant time savings both for nursing and GP staff, and similar time savings for patients. We estimate that the total time savings would be equivalent to one health-care assistant for a practice size of 10-12,000. Practice income was enhanced as a result of the improved information gathering made possible by the kiosks. These effects resulted in improved patient outcomes. The key to successful implementation appears to be strong support, particularly from reception staff to encourage and facilitate the use of kiosks.

Identifies four patterns of use over time, a declining pattern, a stable pattern an increasing pattern and a no trend pattern and discusses the implications of these patterns. For 75\% of the patterns reported there is an initial strong take up in use, often more than a doubling in use, in the first four to five months after a kiosk is installed this is followed by a just as rapid decline in use. The research found differences use between age groups with patients aged 15 and above being more likely to be responsible for the initial strong surge in use. The research reported here forms part of a Department of Health (DoH) funded study which is evaluating the use and impact of more than fifty heath kiosks located in all kinds of locations throughout the United Kingdom.},

We observed work sites to note working processes and tasks related to the information system and interviewed medical personnel. Emergency personnel then participated in the design process to develop a usable graphical user interface, by drawing icon sketches for 23 selected tasks. Similar sketches were requested for specific tasks such as family medical history, contact information, translation, addiction, required inspections, requests and applications, and nurse observations. The sketches were analyzed and redesigned into computer icons by professional designers and the research team. A second group of physicians and nurses then tested the understandability of the icons. The user interface layout was examined and evaluated by system users, followed by the system's installation. Medical personnel reported the participatory design process was interesting and believed the resulting designs would be more familiar and friendlier.},

Yet delivering such applications creates a bottleneck in software development activities. This dilemma can be addressed when firms shift to development methods that emphasize software reusability. This article examines the productivity implications of object and repository-based integrated computer-aided software engineering (ICASE) software development in the context of a major investment bank's information systems strategy. The strategy emphasizes software reusability. Our empirical results, based on data from 20 projects that delivered software for the bank's New Trades Processing Architecture (NTPA), indicate an order of magnitude gain in software development productivity and the importance of reuse as a driver in realizing this result. In addition, results are presented on the extent of the learning that occurred over a two-year period after ICASE was introduced, and on the influence of the link between application characteristics and the ICASE tool set in achieving development performance. This work demonstrates the viability of the firm's IS strategy and offers new ideas for code reuse and software development productivity measurement that can be applied in development environments that emphasize reuse.},

	abstract = {The batch throughput efficiency is studied for three variants on selective reject protocols that operate in a full duplex asynchronous response mode and that adhere to the common architectural features of ADCCP, HDLC, and SDLC. In these architectures, the receiver of information frames may use the REJ supervisory frame to request the sender of information frames to back up to an earlier point in the send sequence. Alternatively, the receiver of information frames may issue the SREJ supervisory frame, which requests resending of a single previous information frame followed by continuation of the ongoing send sequence. The first protocol discussed here uses SREJ as the principle method for recovering lost frames but reverts to REJ recovery if certain combinations of errors occur. The second protocol uses SREJ as the only means for recovery. The third protocol uses SREJ for "isolated" frame losses; if a second frame loss occurs within a specified time after the first, then recovery of the first loss is done by REJ. Results plotted for transmission via satellite at 1.544 Mbits/s show that the selective reject protocols permitted by the current versions of ADCCP, HDLC, and SDLC outperform the simpler REJ protocol only for bit error rates in a narrow range. Thus, it may be worthwhile to consider modifications to these architectures that will permit more flexible selective reject protocols.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Falls are a common occurrence for older adults living in the community that may lead to physical injury and psychological harm. The US Department of Veterans Affairs National Center for Patient Safety (NCPS) database contains root cause analysis (RCA) reviews that identify falls resulting in injury in the community and subsequent action plans that may be helpful to prevent future falls. METHODS: A search of the NCPS-database identified RCA reviews where the patient (community-dwelling and long term care elders) fell in the community resulting in moderate to severe injury. Falls occurred in the home, community living center, outpatient clinic, recreational outing, outdoors, or in a vehicle. Thirty-six RCAs from October 2001 through August 2010 were included. Cases were coded on the basis of location of the fall, primary activity of the patient before/during the fall, root causes, action items, outcome measures, and effectiveness of each action. RESULTS: Sixty-seven root causes resulting in 59 actions were identified from the RCA reports. Falls most frequently occurred in the patient's home (41.7\%). The most common activities the individual was engaged in during a fill included getting up from the bed or chair/wheelchair (22.2\%), walking (22.2\%), and transportation in a wheelchair van (14.8\%). Although many actions yielded improved outcomes, the only action that was significantly associated with improvement was changes made to the environment (p = .028). setting activity CONCLUSIONS: The and surrounding fallsthat occur in the that occur in the community and that result in moderate to serious injury were identified along with the events' root causes. The extremely limited number of reports suggests that there may be missed opportunities to conduct an RCA for adverse events that occur among community-dwelling and long term care elders.},

A set of static measures were used as predictor variables. While doing so, we observed that a large portion of the modules were small, as measured by lines of code (LOC). When we experimented on the data subsets created by partitioning according to module size, we obtained higher prediction performance for the subsets that include larger modules. We also performed defect prediction using class-level data for KC1 rather than method-level data. In this case, the use of class-level data resulted in improved prediction performance compared to using method-level data. These findings suggest that quality assurance activities can be guided even better if defect predictions are made by using data that belong to larger modules.},

	volume = {50},
	doi = {10.1111/j.1537-2995.2009.02518.x},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Blood utilization has long been suspected to consume more health care resources than previously reported. Incomplete accounting for blood costs has the potential to misdirect programmatic decision making by health care systems. Determining the cost of supplying patients with blood transfusions requires an in-depth examination of the complex array of activities surrounding the decision to transfuse. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: To accurately determine the cost of blood in a surgical population from a health system perspective, an activity-based costing (ABC) model was constructed. Tasks and resource consumption (materials, labor, third-party services, capital) related to blood administration were identified prospectively at two US and two European hospitals. Process frequency (i.e., usage) data were captured retrospectively from each hospital and used to populate the ABC model. RESULTS: All major process steps, staff, and consumables to provide red blood cell (RBC) transfusions to surgical patients, including usage frequencies, and direct and indirect overhead costs contributed to per-RBC-unit costs between \$522 and \$1183 (mean, \$761 +/- \$294). These exceed previously reported estimates and were 3.2- to 4.8-fold higher than blood product acquisition costs. Annual expenditures on blood and transfusion-related activities, limited to surgical patients, ranged from \$1.62 to \$6.03 million per hospital and were largely related to the transfusion rate. CONCLUSION: Applicable to various hospital practices, the ABC model confirms that blood costs have been underestimated and that they are geographically variable and identifies opportunities for cost containment. Studies to determine whether more stringent control of blood utilization improves health care utilization and quality, and further reduces costs, are warranted.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this randomized, controlled, home care intervention was to test the effectiveness of two nurse-targeted, e-mail-based interventions to increase home care nurses' adherence to pain assessment and management guidelines, and to improve patient outcomes. Nurses from a large urban non-profit home care organization were assigned to usual care or one of two interventions upon identification of an eligible cancer patient with pain. The basic intervention consisted of a patient-specific, one-time e-mail reminder highlighting six pain-specific clinical recommendations. The augmented intervention supplemented the initial e-mail reminder with provider prompts, patient education material, and clinical nurse specialist outreach. Over 300 nurses were randomized and outcomes of 673 of their patients were reviewed. Data collection involved clinical record abstraction of nurse care practices and patient interviews completed approximately 45 days after start of care. The intervention had limited effect on nurse-documented care practices but patient outcomes were positively influenced. Patients in the augmented group improved significantly over the control group in ratings of pain intensity at its worst, whereas patients in the basic group had better ratings of pain intensity on average. Other outcomes measures were also positively influenced but did not reach statistical significance. Our findings suggest that although reminders have some role in improving cancer pain management, a more intensive approach is needed for a generalized nursing workforce with limited recent exposure to state-of-the-art pain management practices.},

	abstract = {The technique of k-anonymization allows the releasing of databases that contain personal information while ensuring some degree of individual privacy. Anonymization is usually performed by generalizing database entries. We formally study the concept of generalization, and propose three information-theoretic measures for capturing the amount of information that is lost during the anonymization process. The proposed measures are more general and more accurate than those that were proposed by Meyerson and Williams and Aggarwal et al. We study the problem of achieving k-anonymity with minimal loss of information. We prove that it is NP-hard and study polynomial approximations for the optimal solution. Our first algorithm gives an approximation guarantee of O(ln k) for two of our measures as well as for the previously studied measures. This improves the best-known O(k)-approximation in. While the previous approximation algorithms relied on the graph representation framework, our algorithm relies on a novel hypergraph representation that enables the improvement in the approximation ratio from O(k) to O(ln k). As the running time of the algorithm is O(n2k), we also show how to adapt the algorithm in in order to obtain an O(k)-approximation algorithm that is polynomial in both n and k.,},

However, many authors report problems during the evaluation of information technology in health care. In this paper, we discuss some of these problems, and propose possible solutions for these problems. Methods: Based on own experience and backed up by a literature review, some important problems during IT evaluation in health care together with their reasons, consequences and possible solutions are presented and structured. Results and conclusions: We define three main problem areasÂ–the complexity of the evaluation object, the complexity of an evaluation project, and the motivation for evaluation. Many evaluation problems can be subsumed under those three problem areas. A broadly accepted framework for evaluation of IT in healthcare seems desirable to address those problems. Such a framework should help to formulate relevant questions, to find adequate methods and tools, and to apply them in a sensible way.},

Organizational changes such as the decentralization of the health-care system lead to a shift from in-hospital to both advanced and basic home health care. Advanced medical technologies provide solutions for distant home care in form of specialist consultations and home monitoring. Furthermore, the shift towards home health care will increase mobile work and the establishment of shared care teams which require ICT-based solutions that support ubiquitous information access and cooperative work. Clinical documentation and decision support systems are the main ICT-based solutions of interest in the context of ubiquitous computing for shared care environments. This paper therefore describes the prerequisites for clinical documentation and decision support at the point of care, the impact of mobility on the documentation process, and how the introduction of ICT-based solutions will influence organizations and people. Furthermore, the role of dentistry in shared-care environments is discussed and illustrated in the form of a future scenario.},

The requirements of the system have to meet users' needs in relation to both the quality (efficacy, conformity, safety) and the monitoring of all health care activities (traceability). Information analysts need complementary methods to conceptualize clinical information systems that provide actors with immediate individual benefits and guide collective behavioral changes. A methodology is proposed to elicit users' needs using a process-oriented analysis, and it is applied to the field of blood transfusion. We defined a process data model, the main components of which are: activities, resources, constrains, guidelines and indicators. Although some aspects of activity, such as "where", "what else", and "why" are poorly represented by the data model alone, this method of requirement elicitation fits the dynamic of data input for the process to be traced. A hierarchical representation of hospital activities has to be found for this approach to be generalised within the organisation, for the processes to be interrelated, and for their characteristics to be assessed.},

	volume = {28},
	abstract = {This paper considers the analysis of longitudinal data complicated by the fact that during follow-up patients can be in different disease states, such as remission, relapse or death. If both the response of interest (for example, quality of life (QOL)) and the amount of missing data depend on this disease state, ignoring the disease state will yield biased means. Death as the final state is an additional complication because no measurements after death are taken and often the outcome of interest is undefined after death. We discuss a new approach to model these types of data. In our approach the probability to be in each of the different disease states over time is estimated using multi-state models. In each different disease state, the conditional mean given the disease state is modeled directly. Generalized estimation equations are used to estimate the parameters of the conditional means, with inverse probability weights to account for unobserved responses. This approach shows the effect of the disease state on the longitudinal response. Furthermore, it yields estimates of the overall mean response over time, either conditionally on being alive or after imputing predefined values for the response after death. Graphical methods to visualize the joint distribution of disease state and response are discussed. As an example, the analysis of a Dutch randomized clinical trial for breast cancer is considered. In this study, the long-term impact on the QOL for two different chemotherapy schedules was studied with three disease states: alive without relapse, alive after relapse and death.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Affymetrix microarrays are widely used to measure global expression of mRNA transcripts. That technology is based on the concept of a probe set. Individual probes within a probe set were originally designated by Affymetrix to hybridize with the same unique mRNA transcript. Because of increasing accuracy in knowledge of genomic sequences, however, a substantial number of the manufacturer⬚s original probe groupings and mappings are now known to be inaccurate and must be corrected. Otherwise, analysis and interpretation of an Affymetrix microarray experiment will be in error. Results: AffyProbeMiner is a computationally efficient platform-independent tool that uses all RefSeq mature RNA protein coding transcripts and validated complete coding sequences in GenBank to (1) regroup the individual probes into consistent probe sets and (2) remap the probe sets to the correct sets of mRNA transcripts. The individual probes are grouped into probe sets that are ⬚transcript-consistent⬚ in that they hybridize to the same mRNA transcript (or transcripts) and, therefore, measure the same entity (or entities). About 65.6 \% of the probe sets on the HG-U133A chip were affected by the remapping. Pre-computed regrouped and remapped probe sets for many Affymetrix microarrays are made freely available at the AffyProbeMiner web site. Alternatively, we provide a web service that enables the user to perform the remapping for any type of short-oligo commercial or custom array that has an Affymetrix-format Chip Definition File (CDF). Important features that differentiate AffyProbeMiner from other approaches are flexibility in the handling of splice variants, computational efficiency, extensibility, customizability and user-friendliness of the interface.

	volume = {64},
	abstract = {Protection against disclosure is important for statistical agencies releasing microdata files from sample surveys. Simple measures of disclosure risk can provide useful evidence to support decisions about release. We propose a new measure of disclosure risk: the probability that a unique match between a microdata record and a population unit is correct. We argue that this measure has at least two advantages. First, we suggest that it may be a more realistic measure of risk than two measures that are currently used with census data. Second, we show that consistent inference (in a specified sense) may be made about this measure from sample data without strong modelling assumptions. This is a surprising finding, in its contrast with the properties of the two 'similar' established measures. As a result, this measure has potentially useful applications to sample surveys. In addition to obtaining a simple consistent predictor of the measure, we propose a simple variance estimator and show that it is consistent. We also consider the extension of inference to allow for certain complex sampling schemes. We present a numerical study based on 1991 census data for about 450 000 enumerated individuals in one area of Great Britain. We show that the theoretical results on the properties of the point predictor of the measure of risk and its variance estimator hold to a good approximation for these data.},

	volume = {31},
	doi = {10.1080/01621424.2011.644497},
	abstract = {A previous study used aggregate (region-level) data to investigate whether home health care serves as a substitute for inpatient hospital care and concluded that "there is no evidence that services provided at home replace hospital services." However, that study was based on a cross-section of regions observed at a single point of time and did not control for unobserved regional heterogeneity. In this article, state-level employment data are used to reexamine whether home health care serves as a substitute for inpatient hospital care. This analysis is based on longitudinal (panel) data–observations on states in two time periods–which enable the reduction or elimination of biases that arise from use of cross-sectional data. This study finds that states that had higher home health care employment growth during the period 1998-2008 tended to have lower hospital employment growth, controlling for changes in population. Moreover, states that had higher home health care payroll growth tended to have lower hospital payroll growth. The estimates indicate that the reduction in hospital payroll associated with a \$1,000 increase in home health payroll is not less than \$1,542, and may be as high as \$2,315. This study does not find a significant relationship between growth in utilization of home health care and growth in utilization of nursing and residential care facilities. An important reason why home health care may serve as a substitute for hospital care is that the availability of home health care may allow patients to be discharged from the hospital earlier. Hospital discharge data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project are used to test the hypothesis that use of home health care reduces the length of hospital stays. Major Diagnostic Categories with larger increases in the fraction of patients discharged to home health care tended to have larger declines in mean length of stay (LOS). Between 1998 and 2008, mean LOS declined by 4.1\%, from 4.78 to 4.59 days. The estimates are consistent with the hypothesis that this was entirely due to the increase in the fraction of hospital patients discharged to home health care, from 6.4\% in 1998 to 9.9\% in 2008. The estimated reduction in 2008 hospital costs resulting from the rise in the fraction of hospital patients discharged to home health care may have been 36\% larger than the increase in the payroll of the home health care industry.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Health information exchange (HIE), the process of electronically moving patient-level information between different organizations, is viewed as a solution to the fragmentation of data in health care. This review provides a description of the current state of HIE in seven nations, as well was three international HIE efforts, with a particular focus on the relation of exchange efforts to national health care systems, common challenges, and the implications of cross-border information sharing. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: National and international efforts highlighted in English language informatics journals, professional associations, and government reports are described. FINDINGS: Fully functioning HIE is not yet a common phenomenon worldwide. However, multiple nations see the potential benefits of HIE and that has led to national and international efforts of varying scope, scale, and purview. National efforts continue to work to overcome the challenges of interoperability, record linking, insufficient infrastructures, governance, and interorganizational relationships, but have created architectural strategies, oversight agencies, and incentives to foster exchange. The three international HIE efforts reviewed represent very different approaches to the same problem of ensuring the availability of health information across borders. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: The potential of HIE to address many cost and quality issues will ensure HIE remains on many national agendas. In many instances, health care executives and leaders have opportunities to work within national programs to help shape local exchange governance and decide technology partners. Furthermore, HIE raises policy questions concerning the role of centralized planning, national identifiers, standards, and types of information exchanged, each of which are vital issues to individual health organizations and worthy of their attention.},

	abstract = {As the American Recovery and Restoration Act of 2009 allocates \$19 billion to health information technology, it will be useful for health care managers to project the true cost of implementing an electronic health record (EHR). This study presents a step-by-step guide for using activity-based costing (ABC) to estimate the cost of an EHR. ABC is a cost accounting method with a "top-down" approach for estimating the cost of a project or service within an organization. The total cost to implement an EHR includes obvious costs, such as licensing fees, and hidden costs, such as impact on productivity. Unlike other methods, ABC includes all of the organization's expenditures and is less likely to miss hidden costs. Although ABC is used considerably in manufacturing and other industries, it is a relatively new phenomenon in health care. ABC is a comprehensive approach that the health care field can use to analyze the cost-effectiveness of implementing EHRs. In this article, ABC is applied to a health clinic that recently implemented an EHR, and the clinic is found to be more productive after EHR implementation. This methodology can help health care administrators assess the impact of a stimulus investment on organizational performance.},

	volume = {17},
	doi = {10.1136/jamia.2009.000232},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: There has been a consistent concern about the inadvertent disclosure of personal information through peer-to-peer file sharing applications, such as Limewire and Morpheus. Examples of personal health and financial information being exposed have been published. We wanted to estimate the extent to which personal health information (PHI) is being disclosed in this way, and compare that to the extent of disclosure of personal financial information (PFI). DESIGN: After careful review and approval of our protocol by our institutional research ethics board, files were downloaded from peer-to-peer file sharing networks and manually analyzed for the presence of PHI and PFI. The geographic region of the IP addresses was determined, and classified as either USA or Canada. MEASUREMENT: We estimated the proportion of files that contain personal health and financial information for each region. We also estimated the proportion of search terms that return files with personal health and financial information. We ascertained and discuss the ethical issues related to this study. RESULTS: Approximately 0.4\% of Canadian IP addresses had PHI, as did 0.5\% of US IP addresses. There was more disclosure of financial information, at 1.7\% of Canadian IP addresses and 4.7\% of US IP addresses. An analysis of search terms used in these file sharing networks showed that a small percentage of the terms would return PHI and PFI files (ie, there are people successfully searching for PFI and PHI on the peer-to-peer file sharing networks). CONCLUSION: There is a real risk of inadvertent disclosure of PHI through peer-to-peer file sharing networks, although the risk is not as large as for PFI. Anyone keeping PHI on their computers should avoid installing file sharing applications on their computers, or if they have to use such tools, actively manage the risks of inadvertent disclosure of their, their family's, their clients', or patients' PHI.},

APPROACH: The Hippocratic Database approach to securing electronic health records involves (1) active enforcement of fine-grained data disclosure policies using query modification techniques, (2) efficient auditing of past database access to verify compliance with policies and track security breaches, (3) data mining algorithms that preserve privacy by randomizing information at the individual level, (4) de-identification of personal health data using an optimal method of k-anonymization, and (5) information sharing across autonomous data sources using cryptographic protocols. CONCLUSIONS: Our research confirms that policies concerning the disclosure of electronic health records can be reliably and efficiently enforced and audited at the database level. We further demonstrate that advanced data mining and anonymization techniques can be employed to analyze aggregate health records without revealing individual patient identities. Finally, we show that web services and commutative encryption can be used to share sensitive information selectively among autonomous entities without compromising security or privacy.},

	doi = {10.2196/jmir.9.2.e8},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Open source (OS) software is continuously gaining recognition and use in the biomedical domain, for example, in health informatics and bioinformatics. OBJECTIVES: Given the mission critical nature of applications in this domain and their potential impact on patient safety, it is important to understand to what degree and how effectively biomedical OS developers perform standard quality assurance (QA) activities such as peer reviews and testing. This would allow the users of biomedical OS software to better understand the quality risks, if any, and the developers to identify process improvement opportunities to produce higher quality software. METHODS: A survey of developers working on biomedical OS projects was conducted to examine the QA activities that are performed. We took a descriptive approach to summarize the implementation of QA activities and then examined some of the factors that may be related to the implementation of such practices. RESULTS: Our descriptive results show that 63\% (95\% CI, 54-72) of projects did not include peer reviews in their development process, while 82\% (95\% CI, 75-89) did include testing. Approximately 74\% (95\% CI, 67-81) of developers did not have a background in computing, 80\% (95\% CI, 74-87) were paid for their contributions to the project, and 52\% (95\% CI, 43-60) had PhDs. A multivariate logistic regression model to predict the implementation of peer reviews was not significant (likelihood ratio test = 16.86, 9 df, P = .051) and neither was a model to predict the implementation of testing (likelihood ratio test = 3.34, 9 df, P = .95). CONCLUSIONS: Less attention is paid to peer review than testing. However, the former is a complementary, and necessary, QA practice rather than an alternative. Therefore, one can argue that there are quality risks, at least at this point in time, in transitioning biomedical OS software into any critical settings that may have operational, financial, or safety implications. Developers of biomedical OS applications should invest more effort in implementing systemic peer review practices throughout the development and maintenance processes.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: We hypothesized that advanced information and communication technology (ICT) would be acceptable to parents in a pediatric surgical, and diagnostic imaging day care setting. METHODS: After Ethics Committee approval, we distributed surveys, over a one-month period, to parents of children arriving for day care surgery or diagnostic imaging. Parents indicated their acceptance of various proposed modes of postoperative discussion of healthcare i.e.; face-to-face, videophone, or telephone. Parents were also asked to describe their receptiveness to scheduling non-emergency hospital appointments online and to receiving electronic media describing their child's surgery and postoperative management. Parental education, income, and familiarity with the Internet were also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 451 surveys (84\% response rate) were returned. Most parents (95\%) had access to the Internet and 70\% did their banking online. Forty-two percent of the parents had at least a university education and 63\% had an annual family income {\textgreater} \$50,000 Canadian. The majority of parents (98\%) accepted face-to-face interaction, while only 35\% and 37\% of parents were receptive to videophone and telephone interviews, respectively. Computer availability (P = 0.001) and online banking (P = 0.011) were the only variables that predicted those parents who were in favour of using videophone technology. Parents were receptive to instruction electronic media (80\%) and booking appointments online (61\%). CONCLUSIONS: A well-educated and technologically sophisticated parent population does not favour advanced communication technologies over simple, face-to-face interaction in an in-hospital setting. These parents are prepared to receive technology-based information about their child's surgery and to schedule non-emergency hospital appointments online.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: There is increasing pressure to share health information and even make it publicly available. However, such disclosures of personal health information raise serious privacy concerns. To alleviate such concerns, it is possible to anonymize the data before disclosure. One popular anonymization approach is k-anonymity. There have been no evaluations of the actual re-identification probability of k-anonymized data sets. DESIGN: Through a simulation, we evaluated the re-identification risk of k-anonymization and three different improvements on three large data sets. MEASUREMENT: Re-identification probability is measured under two different re-identification scenarios. Information loss is measured by the commonly used discernability metric. RESULTS: For one of the re-identification scenarios, k-Anonymity consistently over-anonymizes data sets, with this over-anonymization being most pronounced with small sampling fractions. Over-anonymization results in excessive distortions to the data (i.e., high information loss), making the data less useful for subsequent analysis. We found that a hypothesis testing approach provided the best control over re-identification risk and reduces the extent of information loss compared to baseline k-anonymity. CONCLUSION: Guidelines are provided on when to use the hypothesis testing approach instead of baseline k-anonymity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The public is concerned about the privacy of their health information, especially as more of it is collected, stored, and exchanged electronically. But we do not know the extent of leakage of personal health information (PHI) from data custodians. One form of data leakage is through computer equipment that is sold, donated, lost, or stolen from health care facilities or individuals who work at these facilities. Previous studies have shown that it is possible to get sensitive personal information (PI) from second-hand disk drives. However, there have been no studies investigating the leakage of PHI in this way. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to determine the extent to which PHI can be obtained from second-hand computer disk drives. METHODS: A list of Canadian vendors selling second-hand computer equipment was constructed, and we systematically went through the shuffled list and attempted to purchase used disk drives from the vendors. Sixty functional disk drives were purchased and analyzed for data remnants containing PHI using computer forensic tools. RESULTS: It was possible to recover PI from 65\% (95\% CI: 52\%-76\%) of the drives. In total, 10\% (95\% CI: 5\%-20\%) had PHI on people other than the owner(s) of the drive, and 8\% (95\% CI: 7\%-24\%) had PHI on the owner(s) of the drive. Some of the PHI included very sensitive mental health information on a large number of people. CONCLUSIONS: There is a strong need for health care data custodians to either encrypt all computers that can hold PHI on their clients or patients, including those used by employees and subcontractors in their homes, or to ensure that their computers are destroyed rather than finding a second life in the used computer market.},

	doi = {10.2196/jmir.8.2.e7},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Personal digital assistants (PDAs) find many uses in health care. Knowing rates of collective PDA use among health care providers is an important guiding step to further understanding those health care contexts that are most suited to PDA use and whether PDAs provide improved health outcomes. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to estimate current and future PDA use among health care providers and to discuss possible implications of that use on choice of technology in clinical practice and research. METHODS: This study was a systematic review of PDA usage surveys. Surveys were identified as part of an ongoing systematic review on the use of handheld devices. Reports from eight databases covering both biomedical sciences and engineering (1993-2006) were screened against distinct eligibility criteria. Data from included surveys were extracted and verified in a standardized way and were assessed descriptively. RESULTS: We identified 23 relevant surveys, 15 of which were derived from peer-reviewed journals. This cohort of surveys was published between 2000 and 2005. Overall, since 1999, there is clear evidence of an increasing trend in PDA use. The current overall adoption rate for individual professional use ranges between 45\% and 85\%, indicating high but somewhat variable adoption, primarily among physicians. CONCLUSIONS: Younger physicians and residents and those working in large and hospital-based practices are more likely to use a PDA. The adoption rate is now at its highest rate of increase according to a commonly accepted diffusion of innovations model. A common problem with the evaluation of information technology is that use frequently precedes research. This is the case here, in which PDA adoption rates are already high and projections are for rapid growth in the short term. In general, it appears that professional PDA use in health care settings involves more administrative and organizational tasks than those related to patient care, perhaps signaling where the growth in adoption is most likely to occur. We conclude that physicians are likely accustomed to using a PDA, and, therefore, technology expertise will probably not be a barrier to implementing PDA applications. However, there is an urgent need to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of specific tasks using handheld technology to inform those developing and those using PDA applications.},

Bioinformatics software is an example of immensely complex and critical scientific software, and this domain provides an excellent illustration of the role of end user computing in the sciences. To explore these interesting characteristics from a software engineering standpoint, we had conducted an exploratory survey of bioinformatics developers. The survey had a range of questions about people, processes and products. As software engineering researchers, we realized that the survey results had important implications for the education of bioinformatics software professionals. We also went through the curricula of more than fifty bioinformatics programs as well as the contents of over fifteen textbooks. We observed that there was no mention of the role and importance of software engineering practices essential for creating dependable software systems. Based on our findings we present a set of recommendations for improving bioinformatics education in software engineering principles and ways that they apply in the context of end-user development.},

Although researchers have been studying the evolution of software systems since the early 70s, the study on the evolution of software development teams remains rare. Such evolutionary patterns and their impact on software quality are especially important in the context of OSS (Open Source Software) development, where a group of volunteer developers collaborate online for an extended period of time. By analyzing how social networks of developers evolve over time while building OSS products, we can gain knowledge and experience to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of resource management and distribution in future OSS projects. To this end, we studied the evolution of the developer communities using a suite of OSS products developed under the KOffice project. We found that in general, the social networks of OSS developer communities change over time in certain ways. Identifying such patterns can help OSS managers better understand the unique process of OSS development and improve their management and coordination of the projects.},

	abstract = {A number of recent studies reported on the success of applying agile methods in scientific software development projects. These studies found that agile methods are well suited to the exploratory, iterative, and collaborative nature of scientific inquiry. However, these findings might not be applicable in all situations pertaining to scientific software development projects. In addition, they only constitute a subset of the important factors while deciding which development methods and practices should be adopted. Therefore, it becomes important to conduct further research before making recommendations regarding the adoption of certain development methods and practices in this domain. In this progress report, we discuss our on-going research that will empirically study the characteristics of various scientific software development projects according to a model suggested by Boehm and Turner. We plan to conduct interviews and collect data from various scientific software development projects in the Baltimore-Washington area. We expect that our qualitative results will increase our understanding of the characteristics in those projects favoring plan-driven approaches or agile methods, and the needs and conditions associated with those characteristics. Our research provides guidance to scientific software developers by enhancing their capacity to evaluate and understand their own project characteristics and select effective software practices. As a long-term benefit in the same direction, our qualitative results will generate a set of hypotheses that can be tested in different project environments to better understand and categorize scientific software development projects. Consequently, in the future, more generalizable and actionable recommendations can be made for scientific software development projects.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:In the United States, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) protects the confidentiality of patient data and requires the informed consent of the patient and approval of the Internal Review Board to use data for research purposes, but these requirements can be waived if data is de-identified. For clinical data to be considered de-identified, the HIPAA "Safe Harbor" technique requires 18 data elements (called PHI: Protected Health Information) to be removed. The de-identification of narrative text documents is often realized manually, and requires significant resources. Well aware of these issues, several authors have investigated automated de-identification of narrative text documents from the electronic health record, and a review of recent research in this domain is presented here.METHODS:This review focuses on recently published research (after 1995), and includes relevant publications from bibliographic queries in PubMed, conference proceedings, the ACM Digital Library, and interesting publications referenced in already included papers.RESULTS:The literature search returned more than 200 publications. The majority focused only on structured data de-identification instead of narrative text, on image de-identification, or described manual de-identification, and were therefore excluded. Finally, 18 publications describing automated text de-identification were selected for detailed analysis of the architecture and methods used, the types of PHI detected and removed, the external resources used, and the types of clinical documents targeted. All text de-identification systems aimed to identify and remove person names, and many included other types of PHI. Most systems used only one or two specific clinical document types, and were mostly based on two different groups of methodologies: pattern matching and machine learning. Many systems combined both approaches for different types of PHI, but the majority relied only on pattern matching, rules, and dictionaries.CONCLUSIONS:In general, methods based on dictionaries performed better with PHI that is rarely mentioned in clinical text, but are more difficult to generalize. Methods based on machine learning tend to perform better, especially with PHI that is not mentioned in the dictionaries used. Finally, the issues of anonymization, sufficient performance, and "over-scrubbing" are discussed in this publication.},

	title = {Evaluating common de-identification heuristics for personal health information},
	volume = {8},
	doi = {10.2196/jmir.8.4.e28},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: With the growing adoption of electronic medical records, there are increasing demands for the use of this electronic clinical data in observational research. A frequent ethics board requirement for such secondary use of personal health information in observational research is that the data be de-identified. De-identification heuristics are provided in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule, funding agency and professional association privacy guidelines, and common practice. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate whether the re-identification risks due to record linkage are sufficiently low when following common de-identification heuristics and whether the risk is stable across sample sizes and data sets. METHODS: Two methods were followed to construct identification data sets. Re-identification attacks were simulated on these. For each data set we varied the sample size down to 30 individuals, and for each sample size evaluated the risk of re-identification for all combinations of quasi-identifiers. The combinations of quasi-identifiers that were low risk more than 50\% of the time were considered stable. RESULTS: The identification data sets we were able to construct were the list of all physicians and the list of all lawyers registered in Ontario, using 1\% sampling fractions. The quasi-identifiers of region, gender, and year of birth were found to be low risk more than 50\% of the time across both data sets. The combination of gender and region was also found to be low risk more than 50\% of the time. We were not able to create an identification data set for the whole population. CONCLUSIONS: Existing Canadian federal and provincial privacy laws help explain why it is difficult to create an identification data set for the whole population. That such examples of high re-identification risk exist for mainstream professions makes a strong case for not disclosing the high-risk variables and their combinations identified here. For professional subpopulations with published membership lists, many variables often needed by researchers would have to be excluded or generalized to ensure consistently low re-identification risk. Data custodians and researchers need to consider other statistical disclosure techniques for protecting privacy.},

A two-year analysis, involving more than 600 patients, found nearly four times fewer severe psychiatric relapses requiring readmission among patients triaged by the crisis intervention service, compared to patients hospitalized without going through its service. The service saved approximately 3,347 days of hospital-based psychiatric care over the two-year study period.

Change-prone classes in open-source products increase project costs by requiring developers to spend effort and time. Identifying and characterizing change-prone classes can enable developers to focus timely preventive actions, for example, peer-reviews and inspections, on the classes with similar characteristics in the future releases or products. In this study, we collected a set of static metrics and change data at class level from two open-source projects, KOffice and Mozilla. Using these data, we first tested and validated Pareto⬚s Law which implies that a great majority (around 80\%) of change is rooted in a small proportion (around 20\%) of classes. Then, we identified and characterized the change-prone classes in the two products by producing tree-based models. In addition, using tree-based models, we suggested a prioritization strategy to use project resources for focused preventive actions in an efficient manner. Our empirical results showed that this strategy was effective for prioritization purposes. This study should provide useful guidance to practitioners involved in development and maintenance of large-scale open-source products.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cost analysis in laboratories represents a necessary phase in their scientific progression. AIM: To calculate indirect cost and thus total cost per sample of various tests at Hematopathology laboratory (HPL). SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Activity-based costing (ABC) method is used to calculate per cost test of the hematopathology laboratory. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Information is collected from registers, purchase orders, annual maintenance contracts (AMCs), payrolls, account books, hospital bills and registers along with informal interviews with hospital staff. RESULTS: Cost per test decreases as total number of samples increases. Maximum annual expense at the HPL is on reagents and consumables followed by manpower. Cost per test is higher for specialized tests which interpret morphological or flow data and are done by a pathologist. CONCLUSIONS: Despite several limitations and assumptions, this was an attempt to understand how the resources are consumed in a large size government-run laboratory. The rate structure needs to be revised for most of the tests, mainly for complete blood counts (CBC), bone marrow examination, coagulation tests and Immunophenotyping. This costing exercise is laboratory specific and each laboratory needs to do its own costing. Such an exercise may help a laboratory redesign its costing structure or at least understand the economics involved in the laboratory management.},

	abstract = {Data mining techniques have been widely used in many research disciplines such as medicine, life sciences, and social sciences to extract useful knowledge (such as mining models) from research data. Research data often needs to be published along with the data mining model for verification or re-analysis. However, the privacy of the published data needs to be protected because otherwise the published data is subject to misuse such as linking attacks. Therefore, employing various privacy protection methods becomes necessary. However, those methods only consider privacy protection and do not guarantee that the same mining models can be built from sanitized data. Thus the published models cannot be verified using the sanitized data. This paper proposes a technique that not only protects privacy, but also guarantees that the same model, in the form of decision trees or regression trees, can be built from the sanitized data. We have also experimentally shown that other mining techniques can be used to re-analyze the sanitized data. This technique can be used to promote sharing of research data.},

A retrospective chart review was performed on all patients at the University of Florida's Family Practice Residency Program who received warfarin pharmacotherapy between October 1, 1988, and December 15, 1993. The outcomes of patients followed by AMS were compared with those of a control group consisting of patients receiving warfarin but followed only by their physician. Outcomes were evaluated based on the number of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic events, as well as unplanned clinic visits, emergency room visits, and hospital admissions. Cost of hospital admissions, emergency room visits, and participation in the AMS were analyzed. During 28 person-years of treatment, control subjects sustained 12 thromboembolic events (2 pulmonary embolisms, 1 cerebrovascular accident, and 9 deep venous thromboses) and 2 minor and 5 major hemorrhagic events. The study group reported two minor hemorrhagic events during a total of 60 person-years. The control group was 20 times more likely than the study group to experience any event (rate ratio 20, 95\% CI 5-87). In addition, hospitalization and emergency room charges indicated an actual cost of \$119,074.95 for the control group's events. The cost to this group for 28 person-years of participation in the AMS would have been \$5040.00. A potential cost avoidance of \$4072.68 per person-year of follow-up may have been possible if these patients had been followed by the AMS. A pharmacist-managed AMS in a family practice setting can result in improved outcomes for patients receiving warfarin and is cost effective.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to find out how many health information exchanges (HIEs) are using metrics to gauge their impact and to gather examples of metrics being used by HIEs. We administered a web-based survey to a list of functioning HIEs. Valid responses were received from 18 HIEs. Most respondents were nonprofits, most had sustainable business models, and half used metrics to gauge their impact. Reduction of duplicative testing, quality improvement efforts, care coordination, and improved readmission rates were cited as having the greatest potential to show return on investment. Most respondents selected patient-centered care as having the greatest potential to show quality improvement. The major limitation of this study is the low response rate. This study suggests that there are no standard metrics used by HIEs to evaluate their impact. The HIE community needs to take the lead in developing metrics to evaluate the benefits of information exchange.},

Yet, how and why OSS is being adopted within hospitals in particular remains a poorly understood issue. This research attempts to further this understanding. A mixed-method research approach was used to explore the extent of OSS adoption in hospitals as well as the factors facilitating and inhibiting adoption. The findings suggest a very limited adoption of OSS in hospitals. Hospitals tend to adopt general-purpose instead of domain-specific OSS. We found that software vendors are the critical factor facilitating the adoption of OSS in hospitals. Conversely, lack of in-house development as well as a perceived lack of security, quality, and accountability of OSS products were factors inhibiting adoption. An empirical model is presented to illustrate the factors facilitating and inhibiting the adoption of OSS in hospitals.},

	volume = {11},
	doi = {10.2196/jmir.1120},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Electronic data capture (EDC) tools provide automated support for data collection, reporting, query resolution, randomization, and validation, among other features, for clinical trials. There is a trend toward greater adoption of EDC tools in clinical trials, but there is also uncertainty about how many trials are actually using this technology in practice. A systematic review of EDC adoption surveys conducted up to 2007 concluded that only 20\% of trials are using EDC systems, but previous surveys had weaknesses. OBJECTIVES: Our primary objective was to estimate the proportion of phase II/III/IV Canadian clinical trials that used an EDC system in 2006 and 2007. The secondary objectives were to investigate the factors that can have an impact on adoption and to develop a scale to assess the extent of sophistication of EDC systems. METHODS: We conducted a Web survey to estimate the proportion of trials that were using an EDC system. The survey was sent to the Canadian site coordinators for 331 trials. We also developed and validated a scale using Guttman scaling to assess the extent of sophistication of EDC systems. Trials using EDC were compared by the level of sophistication of their systems. RESULTS: We had a 78.2\% response rate (259/331) for the survey. It is estimated that 41\% (95\% CI 37.5\%-44\%) of clinical trials were using an EDC system. Trials funded by academic institutions, government, and foundations were less likely to use an EDC system compared to those sponsored by industry. Also, larger trials tended to be more likely to adopt EDC. The EDC sophistication scale had six levels and a coefficient of reproducibility of 0.901 (P{\textless} .001) and a coefficient of scalability of 0.79. There was no difference in sophistication based on the funding source, but pediatric trials were likely to use a more sophisticated EDC system. CONCLUSION: The adoption of EDC systems in clinical trials in Canada is higher than the literature indicated: a large proportion of clinical trials in Canada use some form of automated data capture system. To inform future adoption, research should gather stronger evidence on the costs and benefits of using different EDC systems.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe an analytical framework for quantifying the societal savings and financial consequences of a health information exchange (HIE), and to demonstrate its use in designing pricing policies for sustainable HIEs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a linear programming model to (1) quantify the financial worth of HIE information to each of its participating institutions and (2) evaluate three HIE pricing policies: fixed-rate annual, charge per visit, and charge per look-up. We considered three desired outcomes of HIE-related emergency care (modeled as parameters): preventing unrequired hospitalizations, reducing duplicate tests, and avoiding emergency department (ED) visits. We applied this framework to 4639 ED encounters over a 12-month period in three large EDs in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, using Medicare/Medicaid claims data, public reports of hospital admissions, published payer mix data, and use data from a not-for-profit regional HIE. RESULTS: For this HIE, data accesses produced net financial gains for all providers and payers. Gains, due to HIE, were more significant for providers with more health maintenance organizations patients. Reducing unrequired hospitalizations and avoiding repeat ED visits were responsible for more than 70\% of the savings. The results showed that fixed annual subscriptions can sustain this HIE, while ensuring financial gains to all participants. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the results were robust to uncertainties in modeling parameters. DISCUSSION: Our specific HIE pricing recommendations depend on the unique characteristics of this study population. However, our main contribution is the modeling approach, which is broadly applicable to other populations.},

	volume = {11},
	doi = {10.1186/1472-6947-11-53},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) collects hospital discharge abstract data (DAD) from Canadian provinces and territories. There are many demands for the disclosure of this data for research and analysis to inform policy making. To expedite the disclosure of data for some of these purposes, the construction of a DAD public use microdata file (PUMF) was considered. Such purposes include: confirming some published results, providing broader feedback to CIHI to improve data quality, training students and fellows, providing an easily accessible data set for researchers to prepare for analyses on the full DAD data set, and serve as a large health data set for computer scientists and statisticians to evaluate analysis and data mining techniques. The objective of this study was to measure the probability of re-identification for records in a PUMF, and to de-identify a national DAD PUMF consisting of 10\% of records. METHODS: Plausible attacks on a PUMF were evaluated. Based on these attacks, the 2008-2009 national DAD was de-identified. A new algorithm was developed to minimize the amount of suppression while maximizing the precision of the data. The acceptable threshold for the probability of correct re-identification of a record was set at between 0.04 and 0.05. Information loss was measured in terms of the extent of suppression and entropy. RESULTS: Two different PUMF files were produced, one with geographic information, and one with no geographic information but more clinical information. At a threshold of 0.05, the maximum proportion of records with the diagnosis code suppressed was 20\%, but these suppressions represented only 8-9\% of all values in the DAD. Our suppression algorithm has less information loss than a more traditional approach to suppression. Smaller regions, patients with longer stays, and age groups that are infrequently admitted to hospitals tend to be the ones with the highest rates of suppression. CONCLUSIONS: The strategies we used to maximize data utility and minimize information loss can result in a PUMF that would be useful for the specific purposes noted earlier. However, to create a more detailed file with less information loss suitable for more complex health services research, the risk would need to be mitigated by requiring the data recipient to commit to a data sharing agreement.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to use the activity-based costing approach to give a better insight in the actual cost structure of a positron emission tomography procedure (FDG-PET) by defining the constituting components and by simulating the impact of possible resource or practice changes. METHODS: The cost data were obtained from the hospital administration, personnel and vendor interviews as well as from structured questionnaires. A process map separates the process in 16 patient- and non-patient-related activities, to which the detailed cost data are related. One-way sensitivity analyses shows to which degree of uncertainty the different parameters affect the individual cost and evaluate the impact of possible resource or practice changes like the acquisition of a hybrid PET/CT device, the patient throughput or the sales price of a 370MBq (18)F-FDG patient dose. RESULTS: The PET centre spends 73\% of time in clinical activities and the resting time after injection of the tracer (42\%) is the single largest departmental cost element. The tracer cost and the operational time have the most influence on cost per procedure. The analysis shows a total cost per FDG-PET ranging from 859 Euro for a BGO PET camera to 1142 Euro for a 16 slices PET-CT system, with a distribution of the resource costs in decreasing order: materials (44\%), equipment (24\%), wage (16\%), space (6\%) and hospital overhead (10\%). CONCLUSIONS: The cost of FDG-PET is mainly influenced by the cost of the radiopharmaceutical. Therefore, the latter rather than the operational time should be reduced in order to improve its cost-effectiveness.},

To obtain additional evidence, we identified and compared high-change modules and modules with the highest measurement values in two large-scale open-source products, Mozilla and OpenOffice, and we characterized the relationship between them. Contrary to common intuition, we found through formal hypothesis testing that the top modules in change-count rankings and the modules with the highest measurement values were different. In addition, we observed that high-change modules had fairly high places in measurement rankings, but not the highest places. The accumulated findings from these two open-source products, together with our previous similar findings for six closed-source products, should provide practitioners with additional guidance in identifying the change-prone modules.},

	abstract = {Quality is becoming increasingly important with the continuous adoption of open-source software. Previous research has found that there is generally a positive relationship between module size and defect proneness. Therefore, in open-source software development, it is important to monitor module size and understand its impact on defect proneness. However, traditional approaches to quality modeling, which measure specific system snapshots and obtain future defect counts, are not well suited because open-source modules usually evolve and their size changes over time. In this study, we used Cox proportional hazards modeling with recurrent events to study the effect of class size on defect-proneness in the Mozilla product. We found that the effect of size was significant, and we quantified this effect on defect proneness.},

	volume = {155},
	abstract = {Statistical disclosure control is the discipline that deals with producing statistical data that are safe enough to be released to external researchers. This book concentrates on the methodology of the area. It deals with both microdata (individual data) and tabular (aggregated) data. The book attempts to develop the theory from what can be called the paradigm of statistical confidentiality: to modify unsafe data in such a way that safe (enough) data emerge, with minimum information loss. This book discusses what safe data, are, how information loss can be measured, and how to modify the data in a (near) optimal way. Once it has been decided how to measure safety and information loss, the production of safe data from unsafe data is often a matter of solving an optimization problem. Several such problems are discussed in the book, and most of them turn out to be hard problems that can be solved only approximately. The authors present new results that have not been published before. The book is not a description of an area that is closed, but, on the contrary, one that still has many spots awaiting to be more fully explored. Some of these are indicated in the book. The book will be useful for official, social and medical statisticians and others who are involved in releasing personal or business data for statistical use. Operations researchers may be interested in the optimization problems involved, particularly for the challenges they present. Leon Willenborg has worked at the Department of Statistical Methods at Statistics Netherlands since 1983, first as a researcher and since 1989 as a senior researcher. Since 1989 his main field of research and consultancy has been statistical disclosure control. From 1996-1998 he was the project coordinator of the EU co-funded SDC project.},

	abstract = {Language barriers present a major obstacle to minority ethnic communities accessing primary healthcare. Whereas it is recognised that interpreting services are generally inadequate and inappropriate reliance is placed on family members to interpret, little is known about how nurses working in primary care utilise interpreters to overcome language barriers. The present paper reports on a study examining the utilisation of interpreting services by a range of primary care nurses from the perspectives of the nurses, interpreters and minority ethnic communities. Focus groups were undertaken with five separate groups of district nurses, health visitors, practice nurses, community midwives and specialist nurses, three groups of interpreters from different interpreting services, and five groups of participants from the main community languages in the locality where the study was undertaken (i.e. Arabic, Bengali, Cantonese, Somali and Urdu). Focus group discussions were tape-recorded and subsequently transcribed. Data analysis drew upon the principles of 'framework' analysis. The use of interpreters by primary care nurses varied considerably. Nurses who had received training in using interpreters and who had most control over the timing of patient visits were more likely to use interpreting services. Inadequate training of both nurses and interpreters adversely affected the quality of interaction where interpreters were used. Primary care nurses acted as gatekeepers to interpreting services. Whereas interpreting services were generally perceived to be inadequate, many nurses were accepting of the status quo and prepared to rely on family members to interpret rather than champion the need to improve services.},

	abstract = {The batch throughput efficiency is studied for three variants on selective reject protocols that operate in a full duplex asynchronous response mode and that adhere to the common architectural features of ADCCP, HDLC, and SDLC. In these architectures, the receiver of information frames may use the REJ supervisory frame to request the sender of information frames to back up to an earlier point in the send sequence. Alternatively, the receiver of information frames may issue the SREJ supervisory frame, which requests resending of a single previous information frame followed by continuation of the ongoing send sequence. The first protocol discussed here uses SREJ as the principle method for recovering lost frames but reverts to REJ recovery if certain combinations of errors occur. The second protocol uses SREJ as the only means for recovery. The third protocol uses SREJ for "isolated" frame losses; if a second frame loss occurs within a specified time after the first, then recovery of the first loss is done by REJ. Results plotted for transmission via satellite at 1.544 Mbits/s show that the selective reject protocols permitted by the current versions of ADCCP, HDLC, and SDLC outperform the simpler REJ protocol only for bit error rates in a narrow range. Thus, it may be worthwhile to consider modifications to these architectures that will permit more flexible selective reject protocols.},

	abstract = {Internet-based patient portals are intended to improve access and quality, and will play an increasingly important role in health care, especially for diabetes and other chronic diseases. Diabetes patients with limited health literacy have worse health outcomes, and limited health literacy may be a barrier to effectively utilizing internet-based health access services. We investigated use of an internet-based patient portal among a well characterized population of adults with diabetes. We estimated health literacy using three validated self-report items. We explored the independent association between health literacy and use of the internet-based patient portal, adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, and income. Among 14,102 participants (28\% non-Hispanic White, 14\% Latino, 21\% African-American, 9\% Asian, 12\% Filipino, and 17\% multiracial or other ethnicity), 6099 (62\%) reported some limitation in health literacy, and 5671 (40\%) respondents completed registration for the patient portal registration. In adjusted analyses, those with limited health literacy had higher odds of never signing on to the patient portal (OR 1.7, 1.4 to 1.9) compared with those who did not report any health literacy limitation. Even among those with internet access, the relationship between health literacy and patient portal use persisted (OR 1.4, 95\% CI 1.2 to 1.8). Diabetes patients reporting limited health literacy were less likely to both access and navigate an internet-based patient portal than those with adequate health literacy. Although the internet has potential to greatly expand the capacity and reach of health care systems, current use patterns suggest that, in the absence of participatory design efforts involving those with limited health literacy, those most at risk for poor diabetes health outcomes will fall further behind if health systems increasingly rely on internet-based services.},

	abstract = {Objective Although the patient Internet portal is a potentially transformative technology, there is little scientific information about the demographic and clinical characteristics of portal enrollees and the features that they access.
Design We describe two pilot studies of a comprehensive Internet portal called PatientSite. These pilots include a prospective one-year cohort study of all patients who enrolled in April 2003 and a case-control study in 2004 of enrollees and nonenrollees at two hospital-based primary care practices.
Measurements The cohort study tracked patient enrollment and features in PatientSite that enrollees accessed, such as laboratory and radiology results, prescription renewals, appointment requests, managed care referrals, and clinical messaging. The case-control study used medical record review to compare the demographic and clinical characteristics of 100 randomly selected PatientSite enrollees and 100 nonenrollees.
Results PatientSite use grew steadily after its introduction. New enrollees logged in most frequently in the first month, but 26\% to 77\% of the cohort continued to access the portal at least monthly. They most often examined laboratory and radiology results and sent clinical messages to their providers. PatientSite enrollees were younger and more affluent and had fewer medical problems than nonenrollees.
Conclusion Expanding the use of patient portals will require an understanding of obstacles that prevent access for those who might benefit most from this technology.},

	doi = {10.1186/1472-6947-13-29},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: High levels of adherence to medications for HIV infection are essential for optimal clinical outcomes and to reduce viral transmission, but many patients do not achieve required levels. Clinician-delivered interventions can improve patients' adherence, but usually require substantial effort by trained individuals and may not be widely available. Computer-delivered interventions can address this problem by reducing required staff time for delivery and by making the interventions widely available via the Internet. We previously developed a computer-delivered intervention designed to improve patients' level of health literacy as a strategy to improve their HIV medication adherence. The intervention was shown to increase patients' adherence, but it was not clear that the benefits resulting from the increase in adherence could justify the costs of developing and deploying the intervention. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relation of development and deployment costs to the effectiveness of the intervention.
METHODS: Costs of intervention development were drawn from accounting reports for the grant under which its development was supported, adjusted for costs primarily resulting from the project's research purpose. Effectiveness of the intervention was drawn from results of the parent study. The relation of the intervention's effects to changes in health status, expressed as utilities, was also evaluated in order to assess the net cost of the intervention in terms of quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Sensitivity analyses evaluated ranges of possible intervention effectiveness and durations of its effects, and costs were evaluated over several deployment scenarios.
RESULTS: The intervention's cost effectiveness depends largely on the number of persons using it and the duration of its effectiveness. Even with modest effects for a small number of patients the intervention was associated with net cost savings in some scenarios and for durations greater than three months and longer it was usually associated with a favorable cost per QALY. For intermediate and larger assumed effects and longer durations of intervention effectiveness, the intervention was associated with net cost savings.
CONCLUSIONS: Computer-delivered adherence interventions may be a cost-effective strategy to improve adherence in persons treated for HIV.

CAHs with fewer staff tend to employ alternative business strategies. There is a clear relationship between having IT staff at a CAH and the types of technologies used. Many CAHs report having difficulty expanding upon HIT functionalities due to the challenges of finding IT staff with healthcare expertise. Most CAHs are in the transition point of planning for or beginning implementation of complex clinical information systems. Strategies for addressing these challenges will need to evolve as the HIT investments by rural hospitals race to keep pace with the goals for the nation.},

	abstract = {Increasingly, consumers engage in health information seeking via the Internet. Taking a communication perspective, this review argues why public health professionals should be concerned about the topic, considers potential benefits, synthesizes quality concerns, identifies criteria for evaluating online health information and critiques the literature. More than 70 000 websites disseminate health information; in excess of 50 million people seek health information online, with likely consequences for the health care system. The Internet offers widespread access to health information, and the advantages of interactivity, information tailoring and anonymity. However, access is inequitable and use is hindered further by navigational challenges due to numerous design features (e.g. disorganization, technical language and lack of permanence). Increasingly, critics question the quality of online health information; limited research indicates that much is inaccurate. Meager information-evaluation skills add to consumers' vulnerability, and reinforce the need for quality standards and widespread criteria for evaluating health information. Extant literature can be characterized as speculative, comprised of basic `how to' presentations, with little empirical research. Future research needs to address the Internet as part of the larger health communication system and take advantage of incorporating extant communication concepts. Not only should research focus on the `net-gap' and information quality, it also should address the inherently communicative and transactional quality of Internet use. Both interpersonal and mass communication concepts open avenues for investigation and understanding the influence of the Internet on health beliefs and behaviors, health care, medical outcomes, and the health care system.},

Compounding this complexity is today's norm of geographically distributed teams and code coming in from third-party teams. With so many moving parts, it's difficult for management to get visibility across their internal and external supply chain.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Patient-centered information management may overcome barriers that impede high-quality, safe care in the emergency department (ED). The utility of parents' report of medication data via a multimedia, touch screen interface, the asthma kiosk, was investigated. Our specific aims were (1) to estimate the validity of parents' electronically entered medication history for asthma and (2) to compare the parents' kiosk entries regarding medications to the documentation of ED physicians and nurses.
METHODS: We enrolled a cohort of parents to use the asthma kiosk and tested the validity of this communication channel for medication data specific to pediatric asthma. Parents' data provided via the kiosk during the ED encounter and the documentation of ED nurses and physicians were compared with a telephone-based interview with the parent after discharge that reviewed all asthma-specific medications physically present in the home. Treating clinicians in the ED were blinded to the parents' kiosk entries.
RESULTS: Sixty-six parents were enrolled and 49 of 66 (74.2\%) completed the gold standard interview. When analyzed at the level of individual medications, the validity of parental report was 81\% for medication name, 79\% for route of delivery, 66\% for the form of the medication, and 60\% for dose. Parents' report improved on the validity of documentation by physicians across all medication details save for medication name. Parents' report was more valid than nursing documentation at triage for all medication details.
CONCLUSION: Parents can provide an independent source of medication data that improves on current documentation for key variables that impact quality and safety in emergency asthma care.},

Computer kiosks placed in community settings may help reach such populations. The Reflections of You kiosk generates individually tailored magazines on breast cancer and mammography and was adapted from an evidence-based intervention that increased mammography use in African American women. This usage study tracked patterns of use and characteristics of kiosk users in beauty salons, churches, neighborhood health centers, Laundromats, and social service agencies in St. Louis. Kiosks were used 4,527 times in 470 kiosk days at 40 different host sites. Highly significant differences among community settings were found in rates and patterns of kiosk use as well as user characteristics, breast cancer knowledge, and use of mammography. Findings inform strategic decision making about technology dissemination and community outreach to women needing information about breast cancer and mammography.},

The output is bilingual (English or Spanish) and an enclosed printer allows information to be printed and taken home for later reading. Each kiosk records patient usage, as well as the results of a brief, voluntary, online evaluation questionnaire. Three kiosks were placed in the patient waiting area of busy multi-specialty clinics. Two kiosks were active for 2.5 years and one was active for 1.5 years. There were 38,868 user sessions recorded and 2878 users participated in the online survey questionnaire (7\% of all user sessions). Patient satisfaction was high; for example, 68\% of respondents found some or all of the information they were looking for on the kiosk. In the year following the introduction of the first kiosk (the 2001/02 flu season), there was a 24\% increase in the number of patients receiving flu vaccinations within the Palo Alto health-care system, compared with the previous year. Experience to date suggests that the kiosks may increase patient compliance with selected clinical guidelines and instructions.},

	volume = {35},
	issn = {1553-7250},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Discrepancies in medication documentation most often occur at handoffs or transition points in care. A process improvement team at the Portland Department of Veterans Affairs developed a standardized medication reconciliation process for the Portland chemotherapy administration unit, a physically self-contained clinic with a standard intake process and a uniform patient traffic pattern.
METHODS: The team developed the automated patient history intake device (APHID), a reconciliation software program accessed by the patient using a computer terminal kiosk in the clinic lobby. The program simultaneously checks in patients for an appointment and gathers a medication-adherence history by retrieving medication lists from all Veterans Affairs facilities and pairing each medication with a pill picture. Installation of the APHID kiosk included an initial two-week roll-in period beginning in February 2008.
RESULTS: During the roll-in period, 91 (82.0\%) of 111 patients completed check-in and performed medication reconciliation using the kiosk. Medication lists gathered at the kiosk were compared with existing health record documentation and clinician interviews. For each patient encounter, the process demonstrated an average of 4.59 discrepancies and an average of 1.61 clinically significant or potentially lethal discrepancies. The new process saved approximately 0.24 full-time equivalents of nursing time in the chemotherapy clinic-a nearly 50\% reduction in nursing time dedicated to reconciliation activities without an apparent loss in data accuracy.
DISCUSSION: A patient-centered reconciliation model using consumer-based kiosk technology helped providers efficiently retrieve a comprehensive list of medications across a geographically diverse area and improve patient medication recall using visual cues including medication pictures.},

Given these facts, this paper aims to investigate, through practitioners' perceptions of value, which agile practices are being used to improve two performance criteria for software projects-cost and scope. Using a multivariate statistical technique known as Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), the results suggest that the use of agile practices can be represented in factors which describe different applications in software development process to improve cost and scope. Also, we conclude that some agile practices should be used together in order to get better efficiency on cost and scope in four development aspects: improving (a) team abilities, (b)management of requirements, (c) quality of the code developed, and (d) delivery of software on-budget and on-time.},

Clinician-delivered interventions can improve patients’ adherence, but usually require substantial effort by trained individuals and may not be widely available. Computer-delivered interventions can address this problem by reducing required staff time for delivery and by making the interventions widely available via the Internet. We previously developed a computer-delivered intervention designed to improve patients’ level of health literacy as a strategy to improve their HIV medication adherence. The intervention was shown to increase patients’ adherence, but it was not clear that the benefits resulting from the increase in adherence could justify the costs of developing and deploying the intervention. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relation of development and deployment costs to the effectiveness of the intervention.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Systems interoperability is a key challenge in providing continuity of care to all patients. The challenge is addressed with information standards and new approaches to systems integration based on service-oriented architectures. Model-driven development promise utilities that are suitable for software service development in the healthcare domain, but development tools are still immature and their industry uptake is low. The knowledge about how model-driven development tools can become more useful to the healthcare software developers should be strengthened. Approach: This paper presents the ModelHealth toolchain that was created in four design/assess cycles, involving 28 students and 41 professional developers in the period 2007---2010. The toolchain provides design assistance for creating software services based on concepts from the CEN-13940 standard for continuity of care, which facilitates development of interoperable software services. Results: The CEN-13940 standard was successfully incorporated into the ModelHealth Toolchain assisting developers in creating software service design models that adhered to the standard. The developers expressed that improved understanding of the target system, documentation generation, and artifact traceability were essential utilities of the model-driven approach. Conclusion: The paper concludes healthcare domain knowledge can be successfully incorporated in a model-driven development toolchain, providing valuable input to the healthcare software service design process. A set of recommendations on how to incorporate domain specific concepts into model-driven development tools is provided. To our knowledge, no other scientific publications have reported from healthcare specific model-driven tool design and evaluations. Our recommendations extend and nuance existing knowledge on model-driven development tooling in general.},

We discuss in this paper the application of analysis techniques based on a linguistic approach to detect, within requirements documents, defects related to such an inherent ambiguity. Starting from the proposed analysis techniques, we will define some metrics that will be used to perform a quality evaluation of requirements documents. Some available automatic tools supporting the linguistic analysis of NL requirements have been used to evaluate an industrial use cases document according to the defined metrics. A discussion on the application of linguistic analysis techniques to support the semantic analysis of use cases is also reported.},

Starting from a formalization of the requirements based on use cases extended with contracts, we automatically build a transition system from which we synthesize test cases.

To determine the feasibility of gathering Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) data directly from the patient via a computerized patient interview.

Design
A quantitative descriptive study was utilized to determine whether patients would be willing to self-report their CAM usage and whether the self-reported data complements clinicians perceptions and medical records.

Measurements
40 patients were recruited to test the computerized patient interview application. Clinicians and staff (n=15) were also surveyed to determine their perceived CAM usage. In addition, a retrospective chart review (n=100) was done to estimate the documented CAM usage rate.

Results
In this study, we had a 85\% participation rate, suggesting patients are willing to share their CAM use through the computer application. The self reported usage rate was 85\%, as compared to the chart documented usage rate of 9.5\% and the average clinician/staff estimated usage rate of 43\%.},

	abstract = {A healthcare-use survey was conducted in the Kibera informal settlement in Nairobi, Kenya, in July 2005 to inform subsequent surveillance in the site for infectious diseases. Sets of standardized questionnaires were administered to 1,542 caretakers and heads of households with one or more child(ren) aged less than five years. The average household-size was 5.1 (range 1-15) persons. Most (90\%) resided in a single room with monthly rents of US\$ 4.50-7.00. Within the previous two weeks, 49\% of children (n=1,378) aged less than five years (under-five children) and 18\% of persons (n=1,139) aged ≥5 years experienced febrile, diarrhoeal or respiratory illnesses. The large majority ({\textgreater}75\%) of illnesses were associated with healthcare-seeking. While licensed clinics were the most-frequently visited settings, kiosks, unlicensed care providers, and traditional healers were also frequently visited. Expense was cited most often (50\%) as the reason for not seeking healthcare. Of those who sought healthcare, 34-44\% of the first and/or the only visits were made with non-licensed care providers, potentially delaying opportunities for early optimal intervention. The proportions of patients accessing healthcare facilities were higher with diarrhoeal disease and fever (but not for respiratory diseases in under-five children) than those reported from a contemporaneous study conducted in a rural area in Kenya. The findings support community-based rather than facility-based surveillance in this setting to achieve objectives for comprehensive assessment of the burden of disease.},

	abstract = {Objectives
To explore the integration of online patient Record Access within UK Primary Care, its perceived impacts on workload and service quality, and barriers to implementation.

Design
Mixed format survey of clinicians, administrators and patients. Telephone interviews with non-users.

Setting
Primary care centres within NHS England that had offered online record access for the preceding year.

Participants
Of the 57 practices initially agreeing to pilot the system, 32 had adopted it and 16 of these returned questionnaires. The 42 individual respondents included 14 practice managers, 15 clinicians and 13 patients. Follow-up interviews were conducted with one participant from 15 of the 25 non-adopter practices.

Results
Most professionals believed that the system is easy to integrate within primary care; while most patients found it easy to integrate within their daily lives. Professionals perceived no increase in the volume of patient queries or clinical consultations as a result of Record Access; indeed some believed that these had decreased. Most clinicians and patients believed that the service had improved mutual trust, communication, patients' health knowledge and health behaviour. Inhibiting factors included concerns about security, liability and resource requirements. Non-adoption was most frequently attributed to competing priorities, rather than negative beliefs about the service.

Conclusions
Record access has an important role to play in supporting patient-focused healthcare policies in the UK and may be easily accommodated within existing services. Additional materials to facilitate patient recruitment, inform system set-up processes, and assure clinicians of their legal position are likely to encourage more widespread adoption.},

	volume = {10},
	doi = {10.1186/1472-6947-10-18},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A common disclosure control practice for health datasets is to identify small geographic areas and either suppress records from these small areas or aggregate them into larger ones. A recent study provided a method for deciding when an area is too small based on the uniqueness criterion. The uniqueness criterion stipulates that an the area is no longer too small when the proportion of unique individuals on the relevant variables (the quasi-identifiers) approaches zero. However, using a uniqueness value of zero is quite a stringent threshold, and is only suitable when the risks from data disclosure are quite high. Other uniqueness thresholds that have been proposed for health data are 5\% and 20\%. METHODS: We estimated uniqueness for urban Forward Sortation Areas (FSAs) by using the 2001 long form Canadian census data representing 20\% of the population. We then constructed two logistic regression models to predict when the uniqueness is greater than the 5\% and 20\% thresholds, and validated their predictive accuracy using 10-fold cross-validation. Predictor variables included the population size of the FSA and the maximum number of possible values on the quasi-identifiers (the number of equivalence classes). RESULTS: All model parameters were significant and the models had very high prediction accuracy, with specificity above 0.9, and sensitivity at 0.87 and 0.74 for the 5\% and 20\% threshold models respectively. The application of the models was illustrated with an analysis of the Ontario newborn registry and an emergency department dataset. At the higher thresholds considerably fewer records compared to the 0\% threshold would be considered to be in small areas and therefore undergo disclosure control actions. We have also included concrete guidance for data custodians in deciding which one of the three uniqueness thresholds to use (0\%, 5\%, 20\%), depending on the mitigating controls that the data recipients have in place, the potential invasion of privacy if the data is disclosed, and the motives and capacity of the data recipient to re-identify the data. CONCLUSION: The models we developed can be used to manage the re-identification risk from small geographic areas. Being able to choose among three possible thresholds, a data custodian can adjust the definition of small geographic area to the nature of the data and recipient.},

In this article, the authors formulate and test a hypothesis stating that smaller modules are proportionally more coupled, given that dependencies caused by coupling have been consistently associated with defect-proneness. Strong evidence supports this hypothesis. Furthermore, refactoring exacerbates this effect. On the basis of this study’s highly consistent results, the authors state the empirically based theory of relative dependency. That is, in large-scale software systems, smaller modules will be proportionally more dependent compared to larger ones. These findings have two implications for practice. First, we now have an empirically supported mechanism explaining the observations that defect concentration is higher in smaller modules. Practitioners can use this mechanism as evidence while seeking resources and support to revise or amend their organizations’ quality assurance and quality control practices. Second, particularly for the projects that refactor extensively, such as those using agile methods, focusing defect detection activities on smaller modules will increase their efficiency and effectiveness even more.},

Understanding the nature of that relationship can facilitate various development decisions related to prioritization of quality assurance activities. Overall, the previous research only drew a general conclusion that there was a monotonically increasing relationship between module size and defect proneness. In this study, we analyzed class-level size and defect data in order to increase our understanding of this crucial relationship. We studied four large-scale object-oriented products, Mozilla, Cn3d, JBoss, and Eclipse. We observed that defect proneness increased as class size increased, but at a slower rate; smaller classes were proportionally more problematic than larger classes. Therefore, practitioners should consider giving higher priority to smaller modules when planning focused quality assurance activities with limited resources. For example, in Mozilla and Eclipse, an inspection strategy investing 80 percent of available resources on 100-LOC classes and the rest on 1,000-LOC classes would be more than twice as cost-effective as the opposite strategy. These results should be immediately useful to guide focused quality-assurance activities in large-scale software projects.},

METHODS: We use HIV patient care quality and coordination indicators from electronic data systems to describe care delivery in six RWP demonstration sites and describe HIE interventions designed to enhance that care. RESULTS: Among patients currently in care, 91\% were retained in care in the previous six months (range across sites: 63-99\%), 79\% were appropriately prescribed antiretroviral therapy (54-91\%) and 52\% had achieved undetectable HIV viral load (16-85\%). To facilitate coordination of care across clinical and support services, sites designed HIE interventions to access a variety of data systems (e.g. surveillance, electronic health records, laboratory and billing) and focused on improving linkage and retention, quality and efficiency of care and increased access to patient information. DISCUSSION: Care quality in RWP settings can be improved with HIE tools facilitating linkage, retention and coordination of care. When fully leveraged, HIE interventions have the potential to improve coordination of care and thereby enhance patient health outcomes.},

Driven by mutual benefits, or by regulations that require certain data to be published, there is a demand for the exchange and publication of data among various parties.

The current practice in data publishing relies mainly on policies and guidelines as to what types of data can be published and on agreements on the use of published data. This approach alone may lead to excessive data distortion or insufficient protection. Privacy-preserving data publishing (PPDP) provides methods and tools for publishing useful information while preserving data privacy. Recently, PPDP has received considerable attention in research communities, and many approaches have been proposed for different data publishing scenarios. In this survey, we will systematically summarize and evaluate different approaches to PPDP, study the challenges in practical data publishing, clarify the differences and requirements that distinguish PPDP from other related problems, and propose future research directions.},

	volume = {47},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study asks: What theories are employed in telemedicine studies? How might they be categorized in ways that help distinguish the knowledge base of telemedicine? METHODS: Theories in use were identified from a database of telemedicine-related publications between 1990 and 2005. Eighty-three (5\% of 1615) articles referred to a theoretical concept. Grounded Theory procedures were used to analyze and categorize theories, while descriptive statistics were used for supplementary information. RESULTS: The proportion of studies with theory was 3\% in 1999 and 7\% in 2005. The 83 articles were dispersed among 48 of the in total 795 different journals in the original sample. Identified theories were grouped into two main categories; 'shared' (used in two or more studies) and 'lone ranger'. All of the shared theories are social science theories employed without notable adjustments to any uniquely defining features of telemedicine; diffusion, technology acceptance, health behavior, science and technology studies (STS), and economics. Theoretical concepts within the lone ranger category may well address unique features of telemedicine, but have yet to attract the attention of colleagues. CONCLUSION: The theories identified as 'shared' play an important role, but are inadequate in illuminating any unique features of telemedicine. The future of telemedicine as a field will need to identify its underlying theoretical components. Frameworks employed in the field of evaluation may aid in identifying the types of theories worth articulating in telemedicine.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Use and Acceptance of an Electronic Health Record: Factors Affecting Physician Attitudes Mary Elizabeth Morton Susan Wiedenbeck, Ph.D. and Katherine W. McCain, Ph.D. The benefits of using electronic health records (EHRs) are well-documented; however, a number of implementation barriers have impeded their widespread use. The literature provides evidence of failed clinical system implementations, due to lack of adoption by users. Health care organizations must be prepared to anticipate and manage changes that will accompany implementation of a new information system. As the key coordinator and provider of patient care, physician acceptance of an EHR application will determine the overall success of a product's implementation. The objective of this study was to determine the individual characteristics and sociotechnical factors that may contribute to physician acceptance of an EHR. A hypothesized causal model grounded in Diffusion of Innovations theory and the Technology Acceptance Model was developed using case study and survey methods, and was tested using structural equation modeling (SEM). An online survey was distributed to 802 faculty, fellow and resident physicians in an acute care teaching institution in the southeastern United States. Overall response rate was 29.8\%. The model variables explained over 73\% of the variance in EHR attitude and acceptable model fit was achieved. Individual physician characteristics did not correlate with attitudes in this population. Factors contributing to physician acceptance include: management support, physician involvement in selection and implementation, xiii perceptions of the EHR's impact on physician autonomy, doctor-patient relationship, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. Study participants also expressed concerns about perceptions of the EHR's potential negative impact on clinical workflow and efficiency. Adequate training was not a significant predictor of attitudes. Significant contributions of this study include development of an EHR Acceptance Model for assessing physician attitudes prior to EHR implementation. Other healthcare institutions may find this framework useful for assessing EHR readiness. The findings may aid software developers in designing products to accommodate multiple clinical specialties and user skill levels. The results provide empirical support for a theory about the impact of sociotechnical factors on physician attitudes about EHR adoption.},

	abstract = {We describe our findings and experiences from our technical review of vote verification systems for the Maryland State Board of Elections (SBE). The review included the following four systems for possible use together with Maryland’s existing Diebold AccuVote-TS (touch screen) voting system: VoteHere Sentinel; SCYTL Pnyx.DRE; MIT-Selker audio system; Diebold voter verified paper audit trail. As a baseline, we also examined the SBE’s procedures for ‘‘parallel testing’’ of its Diebold system. For each system, we examined how it enables voters who use touch screens to verify that their votes are cast as intended, recorded as cast, and reported as recorded. We also examined how well it permits post-election auditing. To this end, we considered implementation, impact on current state voting processes and procedures, impact on voting, functional completeness, security against fraud, attack and failure, reliability, accessibility, and voter privacy. Our principal findings are, first, that each system we examined may at some point provide a degree of vote verification beyond what is available through the Diebold System as currently implemented, provided the system were fully developed, fully integrated with the Diebold system, and effectively implemented. Second, none of the systems is yet a fully developed, commercially ready product. This interdisciplinary study-the first of its kind-is of interest for the way in which it evaluates the systems, for the technical questions it raises about standard interfaces, and as a snapshot of the state of vote verification technologies and their commercial development.},

Often legislative requirements to obtain consent are waived if the information collected or disclosed is de-identified. OBJECTIVE: The authors developed and empirically evaluated a new globally optimal de-identification algorithm that satisfies the k-anonymity criterion and that is suitable for health datasets. DESIGN: Authors compared OLA (Optimal Lattice Anonymization) empirically to three existing k-anonymity algorithms, Datafly, Samarati, and Incognito, on six public, hospital, and registry datasets for different values of k and suppression limits. Measurement Three information loss metrics were used for the comparison: precision, discernability metric, and non-uniform entropy. Each algorithm's performance speed was also evaluated. RESULTS: The Datafly and Samarati algorithms had higher information loss than OLA and Incognito; OLA was consistently faster than Incognito in finding the globally optimal de-identification solution. CONCLUSIONS: For the de-identification of health datasets, OLA is an improvement on existing k-anonymity algorithms in terms of information loss and performance.},

We consistently observed a power-law relationship where defect proneness increases at a slower rate compared to size. Therefore, smaller modules are proportionally more defect prone. We externally validated the application of our results for two commercial systems. Given limited and fixed resources for code inspections, there would be an impressive improvement in the cost-effectiveness, as much as 341\% in one of the systems, if a smallest-first strategy were preferred over a largest-first one. The consistent results obtained in this study led us to state a theory of relative defect proneness (RDP): In large-scale software systems, smaller modules will be proportionally more defect-prone compared to larger ones. We suggest that practitioners consider our results and give higher priority to smaller modules in their focused quality assurance efforts.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2008.07.006},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study applied a modified version of the extended technology acceptance model (TAM2) to examine the factors determining the acceptance of health IT applications by caregivers in long-term care facilities. The antecedent variables, including social influence factors such as subjective norm and image were examined together with demographic variables including age, job level, long-term care work experience and computer skills in regard to their impact on caregivers' acceptance of health IT applications. METHODS: A self-administered questionnaire was developed based on the validated items from TAM2. The data was collected in a cross-sectional survey using convenience sample. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling techniques were used to validate our causal model. RESULTS: Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and computer skills had significant positive impact, whereas image had significant negative impact on caregivers' intention to use health IT applications. Image, subjective norm and computer skills also indirectly impacted on intention through the mediating factor of ease of use. Ease of use, subjective norm and job level also determined perceived usefulness. The other demographic factors (including age and long-term care work experience) did not have any significant effect on caregivers' acceptance of a health IT application. Our model explains 34\% of caregivers' intention to use an introduced IT application before any hands-on experience with the system established. CONCLUSIONS: The planners and managers should ensure that a health IT application to be introduced into a long-term care facility is useful and easy to use. Effort should be focused on forming a positive social norm for the introduction of the new innovation and improving caregivers' computer skills. Securing the managers' and senior nurses' support for the innovation at the onset of the project is critical for success. Finally the caregivers appear to dislike the idea of increased IT ability will elevate their status.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The use of information technology in the health care sector and especially in hospitals offers great potential for improving the quality of services provided and the efficiency and effectiveness of the personnel, but also for reducing the organizational expenses. However, the main question that arises according to the literature is whether hospital personnel are willing to use state of the art information technology while performing their tasks. This study attempts to address this issue by developing and testing a modified technology acceptance model taking into consideration other relevant models found in the literature. METHOD: The original TAM has been extended to include some exogenous variables in order to examine HIS acceptance by Greek hospital personnel. Correlation, explanatory and confirmation factor analysis was performed to test the reliability and validity of the measurement model. The structural equation modeling technique has also been used to evaluate the causal model. RESULTS: The results indicate that perceived usefulness, ease of use, social influence, attitude, facilitating conditions and self-efficacy significantly affect hospital personnel behavioral intention. Training has a strong indirect impact on behavioral intention through the mediators of facilitating condition and ease of use. Furthermore, the existence of significant positive effects between self-efficacy and social influence, perceived usefulness and anxiety, and facilitating conditions and social influence is also supported. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed model can explain 87\% of the variance of behavioral intention indicating that the core constructs of the technology acceptance models have a strong and statistically significant influence on hospital personnel usage intention.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In public health and health services research, the inclusion of geographic information in data sets is critical. Because of concerns over the re-identification of patients, data from small geographic areas are either suppressed or the geographic areas are aggregated into larger ones. Our objective is to estimate the population size cut-off at which a geographic area is sufficiently large so that no data suppression or further aggregation is necessary. DESIGN: The 2001 Canadian census data were used to conduct a simulation to model the relationship between geographic area population size and uniqueness for some common demographic variables. Cut-offs were computed for geographic area population size, and prediction models were developed to estimate the appropriate cut-offs. MEASUREMENTS: Re-identification risk was measured using uniqueness. Geographic area population size cut-offs were estimated using the maximum number of possible values in the data set and a traditional entropy measure. RESULTS: The model that predicted population cut-offs using the maximum number of possible values in the data set had R2 values around 0.9, and relative error of prediction less than 0.02 across all regions of Canada. The models were then applied to assess the appropriate geographic area size for the prescription records provided by retail and hospital pharmacies to commercial research and analysis firms. CONCLUSIONS: To manage re-identification risk, the prediction models can be used by public health professionals, health researchers, and research ethics boards to decide when the geographic area population size is sufficiently large.},

	volume = {79},
	doi = {10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2009.12.003},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: To identify and describe physicians' beliefs about use of electronic medical records (EMR) and computerized provider order entry (CPOE) for inpatient and outpatient care, to build an understanding of what factors shape information technology (IT) use behavior in the unique context of health care delivery. METHODS: Semi-structured qualitative research interviews were carried out, following the beliefs elicitation approach. Twenty physicians from two large Midwest US hospitals participated. Physicians were asked questions to elicit beliefs and experiences pertaining to their use of EMR and CPOE. Questions were based on a broad set of behavior-shaping beliefs and the methods commonly used to elicit those beliefs. RESULTS: Qualitative analysis revealed numerous themes related to the perceived emotional and instrumental outcomes of EMR and CPOE use; perceived external and personal normative pressure to use those systems; perceived volitional control over use behavior; perceived facilitators and barriers to system use; and perceptions about the systems and how they were implemented. EMR and CPOE were commonly believed to both improve and worsen the ease and quality of personal performance, productivity and efficiency, and patient outcomes. Physicians felt encouraged by employers and others to use the systems but also had personal role-related and moral concerns about doing so. Perceived facilitators and barriers were numerous and had their sources in all aspects of the work system. CONCLUSION: Given the breadth and detail of elicited beliefs, numerous design and policy implications can be identified. Additionally, the findings are a first step toward developing a theory of health IT acceptance and use contextualized to the unique setting of health care.},

In this paper, we report the findings of a study where we tested the theory of RDP using ten CSS products. The results clearly confirm the theory of RDP. We also demonstrate the useful practical implications of this theory in terms of defect-detection effectiveness. Therefore, this study does not only make research contributions by rigorously testing a scientific theory for a different category of software products, but also provides useful insights and evidence to practitioners for revising their existing QA practices.},

	abstract = {Adequate budget control in pathology practice requires accurate allocation of resources. Any changes in types and numbers of specimens handled or protocols used will directly affect the pathologists' workload and consequently the allocation of resources. The aim of the present study was to develop a model for measuring the pathologists' workload that can take into account the changes mentioned above. The diagnostic process was analyzed and broken up into separate activities. The time needed to perform these activities was measured. Based on linear regression analysis, for each activity, the time needed was calculated as a function of the number of slides or blocks involved. The total pathologists' time required for a range of specimens was calculated based on standard protocols and validated by comparing to actually measured workload. Cutting up, microscopic procedures and dictating turned out to be highly correlated to number of blocks and/or slides per specimen. Calculated workload per type of specimen was significantly correlated to the actually measured workload. Modeling pathologists' workload based on formulas that calculate workload per type of specimen as a function of the number of blocks and slides provides a basis for a comprehensive, yet flexible, activity-based costing system for pathology.},

Publication is largely done in the same manner today as it was fifty years ago. Many journals have adopted electronic formats, however, their orientation and style is little different from a printed document. The documents tend to be static and take little advantage of computational resources that might be available. Recent work, Gentleman and Temple Lang (2003), suggests a methodology and basic infrastructure that can be used to publish documents in a substantially different way. Their approach is suitable for the publication of papers whose message relies on computation. Stated quite simply, Gentleman and Temple Lang (2003) propose a paradigm where documents are mixtures of code and text. Such documents may be self-contained or they may be a component of a compendium which provides the infrastructure needed to provide access to data and supporting software. These documents, or compendiums, can be processed in a number of different ways. One transformation will be to replace the code with its output – thereby providing the familiar, but limited, static document. {\textless}p /{\textgreater} In this paper we apply these concepts to a seminal paper in bioinformatics, namely The Molecular Classification of Cancer, Golub et al (1999). The authors of that paper have generously provided data and other information that have allowed us to largely reproduce their results.

This paper proposes and evaluates an optimization algorithm for the powerful de-identification procedure known as k-anonymization. A k-anonymized dataset has the property that each record is indistinguishable from at least k - 1 others. Even simple restrictions of optimized k-anonymity are NP-hard, leading to significant computational challenges. We present a new approach to exploring the space of possible anonymizations that tames the combinatorics of the problem, and develop data-management strategies to reduce reliance on expensive operations such as sorting. Through experiments on real census data, we show the resulting algorithm can find optimal k-anonymizations under two representative cost measures and a wide range of k. We also show that the algorithm can produce good anonymizations in circumstances where the input data or input parameters preclude finding an optimal solution in reasonable time. Finally, we use the algorithm to explore the effects of different coding approaches and problem variations on anonymization quality and performance. To our knowledge, this is the first result demonstrating optimal k-anonymization of a non-trivial dataset under a general model of the problem.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The level of evidence-based practice (EBP) and awareness has not been previously assessed among primary care physicians in Kuwait. The objectives of this study were to quantify the level of EBP and awareness in Kuwait and identify the factors related to EBP.
METHOD: We used a cross sectional study that enrolled 332 primary care physicians in 57 primary care centres randomly chosen in Kuwait. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect the data with a response rate of about 93\%.
RESULTS: Although half of the physicians self reported that they use EBP most of the time, further analysis revealed that only about 24\% of this group had a reasonable understanding of EBP. Most of the clinical practice in the Kuwaiti primary care system seems to be based on the clinician's own judgment or what they learned in the medical school and traditional text books, rather than evidence-based sources. None of the physicians had an Internet connection at their work place and a vast majority of them had no access to international journals nor were confident about critical appraisal of published evidence.
CONCLUSION: Overall level of awareness of evidence-based medicine (EBM) among primary care physicians in Kuwait was considerably low. Training in the areas of EBM as well as making sure the Kuwaiti primary care centres have access to evidence-based sources are critically important if primary care in Kuwait were to become evidence based.},

	abstract = {Context Despite wide promulgation, clinical practice guidelines have had limited effect on changing physician behavior. Little is known about the process and factors involved in changing physician practices in response to guidelines.Objective To review barriers to physician adherence to clinical practice guidelines.Data Sources We searched the MEDLINE, Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC),
and HealthSTAR databases (January 1966 to January 1998); bibliographies; textbooks
on health behavior or public health; and references supplied by experts to
find English-language article titles that describe barriers to guideline adherence.Study Selection Of 5658 articles initially identified, we selected 76 published studies
describing at least 1 barrier to adherence to clinical practice guidelines,
practice parameters, clinical policies, or national consensus statements.
One investigator screened titles to identify candidate articles, then 2 investigators
independently reviewed the texts to exclude articles that did not match the
criteria. Differences were resolved by consensus with a third investigator.Data Extraction Two investigators organized barriers to adherence into a framework according
to their effect on physician knowledge, attitudes, or behavior. This organization
was validated by 3 additional investigators.Data Synthesis The 76 articles included 120 different surveys investigating 293 potential
barriers to physician guideline adherence, including awareness (n = 46), familiarity
(n = 31), agreement (n = 33), self-efficacy (n = 19), outcome expectancy (n
= 8), ability to overcome the inertia of previous practice (n = 14), and absence
of external barriers to perform recommendations (n = 34). The majority of
surveys (70 [58\%] of 120) examined only 1 type of barrier.Conclusions Studies on improving physician guideline adherence may not be generalizable,
since barriers in one setting may not be present in another. Our review offers
a differential diagnosis for why physicians do not follow practice guidelines,
as well as a rational approach toward improving guideline adherence and a
framework for future research.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND The use of electronic health records (EHR) is widely recommended as a means to improve the quality, safety and efficiency of US healthcare. Relatively little is known, however, about how implementation and use of this technology affects the work of clinicians and support staff who provide primary health care in small, independent practices. OBJECTIVE To study the impact of EHR use on clinician and staff work burden in small, community-based primary care practices. DESIGN We conducted in-depth field research in seven community-based primary care practices. A team of field researchers spent 9–14 days over a 4–8 week period observing work in each practice, following patients through the practices, conducting interviews with key informants, and collecting documents and photographs. Field research data were coded and analyzed by a multidisciplinary research team, using a grounded theory approach. PARTICIPANTS All practice members and selected patients in seven community-based primary care practices in the Northeastern US. KEY RESULTS The impact of EHR use on work burden differed for clinicians compared to support staff. EHR use reduced both clerical and clinical staff work burden by improving how they check in and room patients, how they chart their work, and how they communicate with both patients and providers. In contrast, EHR use reduced some clinician work (i.e., prescribing, some lab-related tasks, and communication within the office), while increasing other work (i.e., charting, chronic disease and preventive care tasks, and some lab-related tasks). Thoughtful implementation and strategic workflow redesign can mitigate the disproportionate EHR-related work burden for clinicians, as well as facilitate population-based care. CONCLUSIONS The complex needs of the primary care clinician should be understood and considered as the next iteration of EHR systems are developed and implemented.},

It is argued that using extant theory to develop testable models of health information technology (HIT) benefits both research and practice. Methods and procedures: several theories of motivation, decision making, and technology acceptance are reviewed and associated theory-based principles of HIT usage behaviour are produced. Main outcomes and results: the case of medical error reporting technology is used to support the validity of the proposed HIT usage behaviour principles. Further, combining these principles produces a testable, theoretical multilevel model of HIT usage behaviour. The model provides an alternative to atheoretical research and practice related to HIT. Conclusions: developing, testing, and revising models of HIT like the one presented here is suggested to be beneficial to researchers and practitioners alike.},

The electronic bibliographic databases Web of Science, Business Source Elite, CINAHL, Communication and Mass Media Complete, MEDLINE, PsycArticles, and PsycInfo were searched. A cited reference search of articles meeting the inclusion criteria was also conducted to reduce misses. Fifty-two articles met the selection criteria. Among them, 94 different variables were tested for associations with acceptance. Most of those tested (71\%) were patient factors, including sociodemographic characteristics, health- and treatment-related variables, and prior experience or exposure to computer/health technology. Only ten variables were related to human-technology interaction; 16 were organizational factors; and one was related to the environment. In total, 62 (66\%) were found to predict acceptance in at least one study. Existing literature focused largely on patient-related factors. No studies examined the impact of social and task factors on acceptance, and few tested the effects of organizational or environmental factors on acceptance. Future research guided by technology acceptance theories should fill those gaps to improve our understanding of patient CHIT acceptance, which in turn could lead to better CHIT design and implementation.},

Second, empirical evidence indicates that project outcomes ultimately depend on how the implementation process is managed and what the organization and its members do with the system once it is introduced. Finally, the case at hand shows that the nature and overall quality of the implementation strategy can be largely predicted by the key actors involved in the project, given their own background, skills, interest, and level of motivation.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The use of information technology (IT), such as computerized medical records (CMR), has been proposed as a method for increasing the efficiency of delivered services, raising the level of the quality of care provided, and decreasing the number of medical errors. Research on IT and CMRs in health care has focused primarily on hospitals and physicians' offices, and there currently exists no nationally representative information for home health and hospice agencies. This report provides the first nationally representative estimates of the prevalence of CMR use in home health and hospice agencies in the United States in 2000.
METHODS: Data are from the 2000 National Home and Hospice Care Survey. Data presented include estimates of home health and hospice agencies that are currently using or planning to use a CMR in the next year. CMR use is also presented by agency characteristics.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 32\% of all agencies were using a CMR. Nearly one-third of home health agencies (32.1\%), one-fifth of hospice agencies (18.6\%), and two-fifths of mixed-type agencies (offering both services) (40.3\%) reported using a CMR. Number of current active patients and provision of "high technology" services (e.g., respiratory, intravenous, or enterostomal therapy) were significantly associated with use of CMRs. While 23.0\% of agencies with 50 or fewer patients reported use of a CMR, the proportion almost doubled to 44.8\%, among agencies with 100 or more patients. Over one-third (34.8\%) of agencies that provided high technology services reported using a CMR, compared with one-fifth (20.8\%) of agencies that did not provide high technology services. No other agency characteristics were found to have a significant relationship with CMR use.},

Home health agencies can use HIT to improve coordination of care provided in multiple locations. The purposes of this study are: 1 to determine the EMR adoption rate and use of point of care technology among a US sample of 1,036 home health/hospice facilities, and 2 to identify the organizational factors associated with EMR adoption. Analyses were performed using SAS and SAS-callable SUDAAN. The study found that not-for-profit agencies, regardless of services offered, were more likely to have an EMR system. Use of point of care documentation was associated with not-for-profit status, large patient panels, and having been in business for less than 10 years. This study extends population ecology theory into innovation adoption theories by explaining possible competitive advantages of EMR adoption within home health care.},

Compared to private practices, CHCs cannot use EHRs to increase visit coding levels and revenues, yet they likely use EHRs more aggressively for QI, which raises equity questions. The evidence suggests that policies are needed that help CHCs to afford EHRs and produce more EHR-related QI gains, including through grants and QI performance rewards.},

Five US rural home health agencies of different types participated in the study. All agencies were not-for-profit and served low-income patients in designated health professional shortage areas or medically underserved areas/populations. A prospective treatment group was telemonitored daily in the home during the period 1 October 2006 to 31 May 2009 (n = 1419). An historical control group was selected sequentially backwards from 30 September 2006 (n = 1502). Both groups had home health services for approximately 50 days (P = 0.76). We used logistic regression modelling, with covariate data captured from the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) data set, to assess the effect of group on outcome. Home telemonitoring was found to reduce the odds of any acute care hospitalization (OR = 0.59, P {\textless} 0.001) and to increase the odds of discharge to the community (OR = 1.36, P = 0.003).},

Patients in the control group showed no clear differences in quality of life at the end of the trial. The telehealth group showed a consistent trend towards improved quality of life on several instruments, including the SF-36, the St George Respiratory Questionnaire and the K10 questionnaire; the improvement in the latter was significant. Hospitalizations were reduced in both the control (−19\%) and telehealth group (−25\%).

	abstract = {A disease management study conducted in home care with 303 patients with diabetes, heart failure, or both revealed information deficits that make disease and quality management difficult. Nurses used a guideline checklist to indicate the amount and type of information available to them on admission and by the end of the episode of care. Nurses reported having data on 7\% to 94\% of the data elements. Whether a lipid profile had been done, the HbA1C (glycosolated hemoglobin test, also called a hemoglobin A1C) levels, or ejection fractions were known for 7\%, 17\%, and 18\%, respectively. When nurses reported information related to ACE-I use (N = 183), they reported that 76\% of patients were on ACE-I (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) or acceptable alternative for heart failure. But no information was reported on ACE-I use for 12\% of the patients (N = 24). Potential solutions to these deficits in information and quality include increased use of guidelines in home care, guideline checklists, information transfer forms, nurse activism to request information, and the adoption of the electronic health record.},

	abstract = {The 1999 debate of the American College of Medical Informatics focused on the proposition that medical informatics and nursing informatics are distinctive disciplines that require their own core curricula, training programs, and professional identities. Proponents of this position emphasized that informatics training, technology applications, and professional identities are closely tied to the activities of the health professionals they serve and that, as nursing and medicine differ, so do the corresponding efforts in information science and technology. Opponents of the proposition asserted that informatics is built on a re-usable and widely applicable set of methods that are common to all health science disciplines, and that “medical informatics” continues to be a useful name for a composite core discipline that should be studied by all students, regardless of their health profession orientation.},

	abstract = {Stanford's two decades of success in linking medical informatics and health services research in both training and investigational activities reflects advantageous geography and history as well as natural synergies in the two areas. Health services research and medical informatics at Stanford have long shared a quantitative, analytic orientation, along with linked administration, curriculum, and clinical activities. Both the medical informatics and the health services research curricula draw on diverse course offerings throughout the university, and both the training and research overlap in such areas as outcomes research, large database analysis, and decision analysis/decision support. The Stanford experience suggests that successful integration of programs in medical informatics and health services research requires areas of overlapping or synergistic interest and activity among the involved faculty and, hence, in time, among the students. This is enhanced by a mixture of casual and structured contact among students from both disciplines, including social interactions. The challenges to integration are how to overcome any geographic separation that may exist in a given institution; the proper management of relationships with those sub-areas of medical informatics that have less overlap with health services research; and the need to determine how best to exploit opportunities for collaboration that naturally occur.},

The results suggest that virtual environments serve effectively for training and mission rehearsal for shipboard firefighting. VE training provides a flexible environment where a firefighter can not only learn an unfamiliar part of the ship, but also practice tactics and procedures for fighting a fire by interacting with simulated smoke and fire without risking lives or property. These tests proved a successful first step in developing a new training technology for shipboard firefighting based on immersive virtual environments. The tests also indicated potential areas for improvement, requiring additional research. User interaction techniques for manipulating objects in VEs need further study, along with usability studies to determine their effectiveness or utility. Other areas that could enhance VE training systems include more natural and intuitive I/O devices such as 3D sound, speech and natural language input, integrated multimedia and hypermedia instruction, and multi user interaction},

Many mandated courses could be covered by CBI at fire stations for substantial savings. Only limited CBI materials for the fire services have reached the commercial market. To meet this need, we are developing a series of CBI packages and testing them working with major fire departments in the Central Florida area. The programs described are: (1) “Spanish for Public Safety” an interactive program for PCs which uses digitized voice recordings to provide instruction in key Spanish language phrases useful for public safety personnel; (2) “Positive Pressure Ventilation” (PPV) a simulation to educate firefighters about PPV techniques; (3) “Fire Command Operations”-a PC-based simulation which offers dynamic interaction and positive feedback; (4) “Fire Departments Lessons Learned”-a database program which catalogs critical incidents; and (5) the “Situational Awareness Training System” (SATS) which provides training for small and mid-sized fire emergencies},

	doi = {10.1109/RAST.2005.1512549},
	abstract = {Once demonstrated that remote sensing technologies are useful in forest fire emergencies, the aim is to provide what users need and when they need it. The inexistence of a fully-operational EO space segment dedicated to these tasks leads to the development of near-operational systems based on current existing technology and trying to conceive new ways of improving results. In this paper, the overall architecture of such a system is presented, compiling the experience acquired in the several aspects of the problem and presenting an integral and comprehensive solution. The system architecture comprises three well-defined parts: the EO reception facilities, the service provider centre(s), and the decision support systems (DSS). The EO data acquisition facilities receive data from sensors whose usefulness for forest fire management has been proved through several demonstrations and studies. This is the case of the MODIS sensor onboard TERRA and AQUA satellites, the AVHRR in NOAA, the CAVHRR in FENG-YUN, and the recent SEVIRI sensor onboard MSG. Future space segments would be incorporated to the system in a progressive manner, leading it into a more operational stage. The service provider centres are conceived as the facilities that ingest EO data from the reception stations along with non-space data, process the information with a set of scientific tools and algorithms (Toolbox), and generate the value-added products directly usable by end-user organizations under an operational scenario. The resulting fire products are then stored in the centre and disseminated to users according to their needs. A near-operational system for forest fire management has to be tailored trying to meet the exact needs of each type of users, focusing specially on real-time requirements. Therefore, this system cannot be either a mere product generator to be accessed by the users or a "just product-oriented" supplier. The only solution to achieve the proposed objectives is to wrap the generated products around a customized and committed service envelope delivered at the user-end. This is the mission of the Decision Support Systems (DSS) installed at user premises, which are an essential tool to achieve operational fire information services using satellite data.},

In particular, Location-based Social Networks (LBSN) are designed as platforms allowing the creation, storage and retrieval of vast amounts of georeferenced and user-generated contents. LBSN can thus be seen by Geographic Information specialists as a timely and cost-effective source of spatio-temporal information for many fields of application, provided that they can set up workflows to retrieve, validate and organise such information. This paper aims to improve the understanding on how LBSN can be used as a reliable source of spatio-temporal information, by analysing the temporal, spatial and social dynamics of Twitter activity during a major forest fire event in the South of France in July 2009.},

	abstract = {Every year lot of properties and lives are lost in fires. When the firefighters start extinguishing fires, they have to enter the fire affected region, but the main problem is that in most cases the firefighters don't have an overall knowledge of inside scenario of progress of fire. Sometime it can lead to death of firemen. As for example nationwide, of the roughly 100 firefighters who die on duty each year, a quarter loses their lives in fires, according to the U.S. fire administration.Nearly half the deaths are the result of heart attacks or other health-related problems. So, when a firefighter loses his life in the line of duty, it is a reminder of the complexity and peril of the profession, despite a dedication to improved equipment and training in recent years. So, if the firefighters have a prior knowledge about the nature of progress of fire within the building/premises, they can plan their action and movement accordingly. In this paper we have proposed a scheme for planning of fire fighting that will help the firefighters to extinguish the fire more effectively.},

	abstract = {This paper provides an overview of four national forest fire management information systems currently used in Canada. The Canadian forest fire danger rating system (CFFDRS) is a non-spatial system, which provides the science framework for fire danger rating in Canada. The spatial fire management system (sFMS) is a geographic information system based fire management information system that implements two core subsystems of the CFFDRS, along with other models and systems. The sFMS is the spatial engine that has been used to implement both of Canada's national forest fire management information systems, the Canadian wildland fire information system (CWFIS) and the fire monitoring, mapping and modeling system (Fire M3). The CWFIS is Canada's national fire management information system; it presents daily information on fire weather, fire behavior potential and selected upper atmospheric conditions. Fire M3 integrates the use of satellite technology for monitoring and mapping large fire occurrence in Canada. Fire M3 also incorporates information from CWFIS to model the impacts of large forest fires based on fire weather conditions and potential fire behavior.},

The absence of accepted standards and thus interoperability and the inadequate integration into transinstitutional health information systems (tHIS) are perceived as key factors. Based on the respective literature and previous experiences in home care projects we propose an architectural model for home care as part of a transinstitutional health information system using the HL7 clinical document architecture (CDA) as well as the HL7 Arden Syntax for Medical Logic Systems. In two short case studies we describe the practical realization of the architecture as well as first experiences. Our work can be regarded as a first step towards an interoperable - and in our view sustainable - home care architecture based on a prominent document standard from the health information system domain.},

Recently, a more radical approach, business process redesign (BPR), or reengineering, has become popular. This article puts BPR into perspective, by considering its theoretical foundations and empirical evolution. Reengineering is classified as a radical approach to organizational change, and shown to complement incremental improvement programs, such as total quality management (TQM). Although the leadership of general managers is critical to BPR success, the enabling role of IT also empowers information systems managers and system analysts. The relevant case study literature is critically reviewed while a BPR initiative in a major Hong Kong bank is examined in detail. A strategic management framework for large-scale process innovation is proposed while a prognosis based on emerging organizational and environmental trends is offered.},

	abstract = {Increasing interest in end users' reactions to health information technology (IT) has elevated the importance of theories that predict and explain health IT acceptance and use. This paper reviews the application of one such theory, the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), to health care. We reviewed 16 data sets analyzed in over 20 studies of clinicians using health IT for patient care. Studies differed greatly in samples and settings, health ITs studied, research models, relationships tested, and construct operationalization. Certain TAM relationships were consistently found to be significant, whereas others were inconsistent. Several key relationships were infrequently assessed. Findings show that TAM predicts a substantial portion of the use or acceptance of health IT, but that the theory may benefit from several additions and modifications. Aside from improved study quality, standardization, and theoretically motivated additions to the model, an important future direction for TAM is to adapt the model specifically to the health care context, using beliefs elicitation methods.},

	title = {Impact of home care on hospital days: a meta analysis},
	volume = {32},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of home care on hospital days. DATA SOURCES: Search of automated databases covering 1964-1994 using the key words "home care," "hospice," and "healthcare for the elderly." Home care literature review references also were inspected for additional citations. STUDY SELECTION: Of 412 articles that examined impact on hospital use/cost, those dealing with generic home care that reported hospital admissions/cost and used a comparison group receiving customary care were selected (N = 20). STUDY DESIGN: A meta-analytic analysis used secondary data sources between 1967 and 1992. DATA EXTRACTION: Study characteristics that could have an impact on effect size (i.e., country of origin, study design, disease characteristics of study sample, and length of follow-up) were abstracted and coded to serve as independent variables. Available statistics on hospital days necessary to calculate an effect size were extracted. If necessary information was missing, the authors of the articles were contacted. METHODS: Effect sizes and homogeneity of variance measures were calculated using Dstat software, weighted for sample size. Overall effect sizes were compared by the study characteristics described above. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Effect sizes indicate a small to moderate positive impact of home care in reducing hospital days, ranging from 2.5 to 6 days (effect sizes of -.159 and -.379, respectively), depending on the inclusion of a large quasi-experimental study with a large treatment effect. When this outlier was removed from analysis, the effect size for studies that targeted terminally ill patients exclusively was homogeneous across study subcategories; however, the effect size of studies that targeted nonterminal patients was heterogeneous, indicating that unmeasured variables or interactions account for variability. CONCLUSION: Although effect sizes were small to moderate, the consistent pattern of reduced hospital days across a majority of studies suggests for the first time that home care has a significant impact on this costly outcome.},

In this paper, we propose several new test suite prioritization strategies for web applications and examine whether these strategies can improve the rate of fault detection for three web applications and their preexisting test suites. We prioritize test suites by test lengths, frequency of appearance of request sequences, and systematic coverage of parameter-values and their interactions. Experimental results show that the proposed prioritization criteria often improve the rate of fault detection of the test suites when compared to random ordering of test cases. In general, the best prioritization metrics either (1) consider frequency of appearance of sequences of requests or (2) systematically cover combinations of parameter-values as early as possible.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To test the effectiveness of two interventions designed to improve the adoption of evidence-based practices by home health nurses caring for heart failure (HF) patients. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Information on nurse practices was abstracted from the clinical records of patients admitted between June 2000 and November 2001 to the care of 354 study nurses at a large, urban, nonprofit home care agency. STUDY DESIGN: The study employed a randomized design with nurses assigned to usual care or one of two intervention groups upon identification of an eligible patient. The basic intervention was a one-time e-mail reminder highlighting six HF-specific clinical recommendations. The augmented intervention consisted of the initial e-mail reminder supplemented by provider prompts, patient education material, and clinical nurse specialist outreach. DATA COLLECTION: At each home health visit provided by a study nurse to an eligible HF patient during the 45-day follow-up period, a structured chart abstraction tool was used to collect information on whether the nurse provided the care practices highlighted in the e-mail reminder. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Both the basic and the augmented interventions greatly increased the practice of evidence-based care, according to patient records, in the areas of patient assessment and instructions about HF disease management. While not all results were statistically significant at conventional levels, intervention effects were positive in virtually all cases and effect magnitudes frequently were large. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this randomized trial strongly support the efficacy of just-in-time evidence-based reminders as a means of changing clinical practice among home health nurses who are geographically dispersed and spend much of their time in the field.},

	abstract = {Our recent studies on single releases of multiple open-source software (OSS) products showed a higher concentration of dependencies in smaller modules. For one of the products, it was observed that an isolatable and observable refactoring initiative exacerbated this concentration inequality. In this paper, we empirically investigate the dependency concentration in smaller modules from a longitudinal perspective: (1) whether this concentration inequality always exists over product life time; (2) how it changes. We hypothesize that the concentration inequality should either remain at same levels or increase over time. This is because large-scale and long-lived software products usually go through some degree of continuous and intermittent refactoring. Our results show that dependencies concentrate in smaller classes in all releases, and this concentration inequality generally increases over successive releases. We suggest that software practitioners continuously pay a higher QA attention to smaller modules. We also recommend increasing such QA focus as a product matures and goes through refactoring activities.},

	volume = {17},
	doi = {10.1136/jamia.2009.000026},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Many healthcare organizations follow data protection policies that specify which patient identifiers must be suppressed to share de-identified records. Such policies, however, are often applied without knowledge of the risk of re-identification. The goals of this work are: (1) to estimate re-identification risk for data sharing policies of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule; and (2) to evaluate the risk of a specific re-identification attack using voter registration lists. MEASUREMENTS: We define several risk metrics: (1) expected number of re-identifications; (2) estimated proportion of a population in a group of size g or less, and (3) monetary cost per re-identification. For each US state, we estimate the risk posed to hypothetical datasets, protected by the HIPAA Safe Harbor and Limited Dataset policies by an attacker with full knowledge of patient identifiers and with limited knowledge in the form of voter registries. RESULTS: The percentage of a state's population estimated to be vulnerable to unique re-identification (ie, g=1) when protected via Safe Harbor and Limited Datasets ranges from 0.01\% to 0.25\% and 10\% to 60\%, respectively. In the voter attack, this number drops for many states, and for some states is 0\%, due to the variable availability of voter registries in the real world. We also find that re-identification cost ranges from \$0 to \$17,000, further confirming risk variability. CONCLUSIONS: This work illustrates that blanket protection policies, such as Safe Harbor, leave different organizations vulnerable to re-identification at different rates. It provides justification for locally performed re-identification risk estimates prior to sharing data.},

We situated the construct within a nomological net using a prevailing and dominant information technology adoption behavior model as a logical starting point.Design A mail survey was sent to the population of users of a regional physician order entry (POE) system aimed at speeding up the transmission of clinical data, mainly laboratory tests and radiology examinations, within a community health network.Measurements All scales, but one, were measured using previously validated instruments. For its part, the psychological ownership scale was developed using a multistage iterative procedure.Results Ninety-one questionnaires were returned to the researchers, for a response rate of 72.8\%. Our findings reveal that, in order to foster physicians' adoption of a clinical information system, it is important to encourage and cultivate a positive attitude toward using the new system. In this connection, positive perception of the technology's usefulness is crucial. Second, results demonstrate that psychological ownership of a POE system is positively associated with physicians' perceptions of system utility and system user friendliness. Last, through their active involvement and participation, physicians feel they have greater influence on the development process, thereby developing feelings of ownership toward the clinical system.Conclusion Psychological ownership's highly significant associations with user participation and crucial beliefs driving technology acceptance behaviors among physicians affirm the value of this construct in extending our understanding of POE adoption.},

	abstract = {Persons with continuous complex care needs frequently require care in multiple settings. During transitions between settings, this population is particularly vulnerable to experiencing poor care quality and problems of care fragmentation. Despite how common these transitions have become, the challenges of improving care transitions have received little attention from policy makers, clinicians, and quality improvement entities. This article begins with a definition of transitional care and then discusses the nature of the problem, its prevalence, manifestations of poorly executed transitions, and potentially remediable barriers. Necessary elements for effective transitions are then presented, followed by promising new directions for quality improvement at the level of the delivery system, information technology, and national health policy. The article concludes with a proposed research agenda designed to advance the science of high-quality transitional care.},

The project was initiated in response to a national strategy to restructure health care after the 1994 elections. Changes included shifting resources from tertiary and secondary care to primary care, devolution of management to district level, and redistribution of resources in response to perceived geographical and sectoral need. The success of these initiatives required managerial, administrative, and clinical processes that were efficient, effective, and equitable. Adequate information was considered essential, not only to facilitate the tasks but also for short and long term monitoring. Limpopo Province has 42 hospitals, comprising two mental health institutions, eight regional hospitals (two acting as a tertiary complex with teaching responsibilities), and 32 district hospitals. The area is one of the poorest in South Africa. IBM was awarded the contract for implementation at a cost of 134m Rand (nearly £14m), which represented 2.5\% of the province's health and welfare annual budget.},

Primary barriers identified were costs, the need for training, and the culture change required to embrace technology. Primary facilitators were training programs, well-defined implementation plans, government assistance with implementation costs, evidence that EHRs will improve care outcomes, and support from state regulatory agencies. These results offer a framework of action for policy makers, LTC leaders, and researchers.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dramatic advances in health information technologies necessitate a comprehensive evaluation framework covering all phases of development, from conception to routine operational use.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this article was to illustrate the application of an informatics evaluation framework that provides a heuristic for matching the stage of system design and the level of evaluation.
METHODS: An evaluation framework is illustrated in the context of five studies in different stages of system design.
RESULTS: The studies discussed in this article represent the various stages of the framework. In addition, they are examples of how evaluation research studies not only contribute to the assessment of system design but also constitute distinct contributions to knowledge.
DISCUSSION: The ability to engineer advanced information systems has exceeded the understanding of how to deploy them effectively in complex settings and to adapt them to a range of user populations. A systematic, continuous evaluation increases the likelihood that the conditions for success will be understood, including how to tailor a system, how to maintain the target population's use of the system, and how to innovate continually to enhance the functionality of the system and the users' experience. Without sound evaluation methodologies throughout the stages of system development, information systems have limited potential to influence healthcare processes positively.},

Questionnaire, interview and observation data from 46 nurses in medical-surgical and intensive care units at two community hospitals within a regional healthcare system (second year of EHR implementation) were analyzed for themes and compared across hospital and unit dimensions. Nurses preferred EHRs to paper charts and were comfortable with technology. They felt EHR use enhanced nursing work through increased information access, improved organization and efficiency, and alert screens. They felt it hindered nursing work through increased documentation time (slow system response, multiple screens), decreased interdisciplinary communication and impaired critical thinking through overuse of checkboxes and "copy and paste" documentation. 73\% spent at least half their work time using EHRs, and felt use enabled them to provide safer care but decreased quality of care. Administrative implications include streamlining EHR work processes, developing guidelines to improve consistency in documentation quality and location, increasing system speed, and choosing hardware that encourages bedside use.},

To identify potential accidents in the making, the authors looked for side effects from a natural experiment, the implementation of bar code medication administration (BCMA), a technology designed to reduce adverse drug events (ADEs).
Design Cross-sectional observational study of medication passes before (21 hours of observation of 7 nurses at 1 hospital) and after (60 hours of observation of 26 nurses at 3 hospitals) BCMA implementation.
Measurements Detailed, handwritten field notes of targeted ethnographic observations of in situ nurse–BCMA interactions were iteratively analyzed using process tracing and five conceptual frameworks.
Results Ethnographic observations distilled into 67 nurse–BCMA interactions were classified into 12 categories. We identified five negative side effects after BCMA implementation: (1) nurses confused by automated removal of medications by BCMA, (2) degraded coordination between nurses and physicians, (3) nurses dropping activities to reduce workload during busy periods, (4) increased prioritization of monitored activities during goal conflicts, and (5) decreased ability to deviate from routine sequences.
Conclusion These side effects might create new paths to ADEs. We recommend design revisions, modification of organizational policies, and “best practices” training that could potentially minimize or eliminate these side effects before they contribute to adverse outcomes.},

	abstract = {Usability factors are a major obstacle to health information technology (IT) adoption. The purpose of this paper is to review and categorize health IT usability study methods and to provide practical guidance on health IT usability evaluation. 2025 references were initially retrieved from the Medline database from 2003 to 2009 that evaluated health IT used by clinicians. Titles and abstracts were first reviewed for inclusion. Full-text articles were then examined to identify final eligibility studies. 629 studies were categorized into the five stages of an integrated usability specification and evaluation framework that was based on a usability model and the system development life cycle (SDLC)-associated stages of evaluation. Theoretical and methodological aspects of 319 studies were extracted in greater detail and studies that focused on system validation (SDLC stage 2) were not assessed further. The number of studies by stage was: stage 1, task-based or user–task interaction, n=42; stage 2, system–task interaction, n=310; stage 3, user–task–system interaction, n=69; stage 4, user–task–system–environment interaction, n=54; and stage 5, user–task–system–environment interaction in routine use, n=199. The studies applied a variety of quantitative and qualitative approaches. Methodological issues included lack of theoretical framework/model, lack of details regarding qualitative study approaches, single evaluation focus, environmental factors not evaluated in the early stages, and guideline adherence as the primary outcome for decision support system evaluations. Based on the findings, a three-level stratified view of health IT usability evaluation is proposed and methodological guidance is offered based upon the type of interaction that is of primary interest in the evaluation.},

However, the recent work to advance health IT is far from an exercise in “magical thinking.” It has been strategic thinking. To illustrate this, we highlight recent initiatives and progress under four focus areas: adoption, governance, privacy and security, and interoperability. In addition, solutions exist for health IT to advance rapidly without adversely affecting future policy choices. A broad national consensus is emerging in support of advancing health IT to enable the transformation of health and care.},

The expanded Medicaid and private insurance coverage are expected to increase demand for health care significantly, particularly for prescription drugs and physician and clinical services. Robust growth in Medicare enrollment, expanded Medicaid coverage, and premium and cost-sharing subsidies for exchange plans are projected to increase the federal government share of health spending from 27 percent in 2009 to 31 percent by 2020.

	abstract = {Background
Home telemonitoring figures among the various solutions that could help attenuate some of the problems associated with aging populations, rates of chronic illness, and shortages of health professionals.

Objective
The primary aim of this study was to further our understanding of the clinical effects associated with home telemonitoring programs in the context of chronic diseases.

Methods
We conducted a systematic review which covered studies published between January 1966 and December 2008. MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, and the INAHTA (International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment) database were consulted. Our inclusion criteria consisted of: (1) English language publications in peer-reviewed journals or conference proceedings and (2) studies involving patients with diabetes, asthma, heart failure, or hypertension, and presenting results on the clinical effects of home telemonitoring.

Results
In all, 62 empirical studies were analyzed. The results from studies involving patients with diabetes indicated a trend toward patients with home telemonitoring achieving better glycemic control. In most trials in which patients with asthma were enrolled, results showed significant improvements in patients’ peak expiratory flows, significant reductions in the symptoms associated with this illness, and improvements in perceived quality of life. Virtually all studies involving patients with hypertension demonstrated the ability of home telemonitoring to reduce systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure. Lastly, due to the equivocal nature of current findings of home telemonitoring involving patients with heart failure, larger trials are still needed to confirm the clinical effects of this technology for these patients.

Conclusions
Although home telemonitoring appears to be a promising approach to patient management, designers of future studies should consider ways to make this technology more effective as well as controlling possible mediating variables.},

Using a grounded theory approach, this article examines the simulated use of a graphical user interface by practitioners in a home care setting to explore the salient features of monitoring the activity of home care clients. The results demonstrate the need for simple, interactive displays that can provide large amounts of geographical and temporal data relating to patient activity. Additional emerging themes from interviews indicate that home care professionals would use a graphical user interface of this type for patient education and goal setting as well as to assist in the decision-making process of home care practitioners.},

	abstract = {Context Organized care management processes (CMPs) can improve health care quality
for patients with chronic diseases. The Institute of Medicine of the National
Academy of Sciences has called for public and private purchasers of health
care to create incentives for physician organizations (POs) to use CMPs and
for the government to assist POs in implementing information technology (IT)
to facilitate CMP use. Research is lacking about the extent to which POs use
CMPs or about the degree to which incentives, IT, or other factors are associated
with their use.Objectives To determine the extent to which POs with 20 or more physicians use
CMPs and to identify key factors associated with CMP use for 4 chronic diseases
(asthma, congestive heart failure, depression, and diabetes).Design, Setting, and Participants One thousand five hundred eighty-seven US POs (medical groups and independent
practice associations) with 20 or more physicians were identified using 5
large databases. One thousand one hundred four of these POs (70\%) agreed to
participate in a telephone survey conducted between September 2000 and September
2001. Sixty-four responding POs were excluded because they did not treat any
of the 4 diseases, leaving 1040 POs.Main Outcome Measures Extent of use of CMPs as calculated on the basis of a summary measure,
a PO care management index (POCMI; range, 0-6) and factors associated with
CMP use.Results Physician organizations' mean use of CMPs was 5.1 of a possible 16;
50\% used 4 or fewer. External incentives and clinical IT were most strongly
associated with CMP use. Controlling for other factors, use of the 2 most
strongly associated incentives—public recognition and better contracts
for health care quality—was associated with use of 1.3 and 0.7 additional
CMPs, respectively (P{\textless}.001 and P = .007). Each additional IT capability was associated with 0.37 additional
CMPs (P{\textless}.001). However, 33\% of POs reported no
external incentives and 50\% reported no clinical IT capability.Conclusions The use of CMPs varies greatly among POs, but it is low on average.
Government and private purchasers of health care may increase CMP use by providing
external incentives for improvement of health care quality to POs and by assisting
them in improving their clinical IT capability.},

	abstract = {Objective: To estimate the incidence and direct medical costs for fatal and non-fatal fall injuries among US adults aged ⩾65 years in 2000, for three treatment settings stratified by age, sex, body region, and type of injury.
Methods: Incidence data came from the 2000 National Vital Statistics System, 2001 National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-All Injury Program, 2000 Health Care Utilization Program National Inpatient Sample, and 1999 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Costs for fatal falls came from Incidence and economic burden of injuries in the United States; costs for non-fatal falls were based on claims from the 1998 and 1999 Medicare fee-for-service 5\% Standard Analytical Files. A case crossover approach was used to compare the monthly costs before and after the fall.
Results: In 2000, there were almost 10 300 fatal and 2.6 million medically treated non-fatal fall related injuries. Direct medical costs totaled \$0.2 billion dollars for fatal and \$19 billion dollars for non-fatal injuries. Of the non-fatal injury costs, 63\% (\$12 billion) were for hospitalizations, 21\% (\$4 billion) were for emergency department visits, and 16\% (\$3 billion) were for treatment in outpatient settings. Medical expenditures for women, who comprised 58\% of the older adult population, were 2–3 times higher than for men for all medical treatment settings. Fractures accounted for just 35\% of non-fatal injuries but 61\% of costs.
Conclusions: Fall related injuries among older adults, especially among older women, are associated with substantial economic costs. Implementing effective intervention strategies could appreciably decrease the incidence and healthcare costs of these injuries.},

	abstract = {Between July 2003 and December 2007, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) introduced a national home telehealth program, Care Coordination/Home Telehealth (CCHT). Its purpose was to coordinate the care of veteran patients with chronic conditions and avoid their unnecessary admission to long-term institutional care. Demographic changes in the veteran population necessitate VHA increase its noninstitutional care (NIC) services 100\% above its 2007 level to provide care for 110,000 NIC patients by 2011. By 2011, CCHT will meet 50\% of VHA’s anticipated NIC provision. CCHT involves the systematic implementation of health informatics, home telehealth, and disease management technologies. It helps patients live independently at home. Between 2003 and 2007, the census figure (point prevalence) for VHA CCHT patients increased from 2,000 to 31,570 (1,500\% growth). CCHT is now a routine NIC service provided by VHA to support veteran patients with chronic conditions as they age. CCHT patients are predominantly male (95\%) and aged 65 years or older. Strict criteria determine patient eligibility for enrollment into the program and VHA internally assesses how well its CCHT programs meet standardized clinical, technology, and managerial requirements. VHA has trained 5,000 staff to provide CCHT. Routine analysis of data obtained for quality and performance purposes from a cohort of 17,025 CCHT patients shows the benefits of a 25\% reduction in numbers of bed days of care, 19\% reduction in numbers of hospital admissions, and mean satisfaction score rating of 86\% after enrollment into the program. The cost of CCHT is \$1,600 per patient per annum, substantially less than other NIC programs and nursing home care. VHA’s experience is that an enterprise-wide home telehealth implementation is an appropriate and cost-effective way of managing chronic care patients in both urban and rural settings.},

It estimates potential savings and costs of widespread adoption of electronic medical record (EMR) systems, models important health and safety benefits, and concludes that effective EMR implementation and networking could eventually save more than \$81 billion annually—by improving health care efficiency and safety—and that HIT-enabled prevention and management of chronic disease could eventually double those savings while increasing health and other social benefits. However, this is unlikely to be realized without related changes to the health care system.},

	abstract = {Home health care clinicians seek to provide high quality, safe care in ways that honor patient autonomy and accommodate the individual characteristics of each patient’s home and family. Falls, declining functional abilities, pressure ulcers and nonhealing wounds, and adverse events related to medication administration all have the potential to result in unplanned hospital admissions. Such hospitalizations undermine the achievement of important home health care goals: keeping patients at home and promoting optimal well-being. Nevertheless, the unique characteristics of home health care may make it difficult to use—or necessary to alter—interventions that have been shown to be effective in other settings. Therefore, research on effective practices, conducted in home health care settings, is necessary to support excellent and evidence-based care. In reviewing the extant studies, the authors of this chapter found useful evidence in all selected areas. However, the number of studies was few and many questions remain. Replications of investigations originally conducted in health care settings other than the home, and studies considering home health care-specific issues are needed to support evidence-based clinical decisions. The available evidence suggests that the work environment in which home health care nurses practice may indirectly influence patient outcomes in many areas, and that technology can be used to support positive patient outcomes. Thus, studies that link nurse-related variables to improved care safety and quality are needed, as well as studies that focus directly on patients. The demographics of an aging society will sustain the trend toward home-based care. Home health care practices grounded in careful research will sustain the patients and the clinicians who serve them. Given the focused review of evidence-based studies comprising this chapter, many informative sources of use to the practicing home health care nurse are omitted. Table 8 lists additional key resources.},

	volume = {144},
	issn = {1539-3704},
	shorttitle = {Systematic review},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Experts consider health information technology key to improving efficiency and quality of health care.
PURPOSE: To systematically review evidence on the effect of health information technology on quality, efficiency, and costs of health care.
DATA SOURCES: The authors systematically searched the English-language literature indexed in MEDLINE (1995 to January 2004), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and the Periodical Abstracts Database. We also added studies identified by experts up to April 2005.
STUDY SELECTION: Descriptive and comparative studies and systematic reviews of health information technology.
DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently extracted information on system capabilities, design, effects on quality, system acquisition, implementation context, and costs.
DATA SYNTHESIS: 257 studies met the inclusion criteria. Most studies addressed decision support systems or electronic health records. Approximately 25\% of the studies were from 4 academic institutions that implemented internally developed systems; only 9 studies evaluated multifunctional, commercially developed systems. Three major benefits on quality were demonstrated: increased adherence to guideline-based care, enhanced surveillance and monitoring, and decreased medication errors. The primary domain of improvement was preventive health. The major efficiency benefit shown was decreased utilization of care. Data on another efficiency measure, time utilization, were mixed. Empirical cost data were limited.
LIMITATIONS: Available quantitative research was limited and was done by a small number of institutions. Systems were heterogeneous and sometimes incompletely described. Available financial and contextual data were limited.
CONCLUSIONS: Four benchmark institutions have demonstrated the efficacy of health information technologies in improving quality and efficiency. Whether and how other institutions can achieve similar benefits, and at what costs, are unclear.},

CQI provided the foundation for other strategies that served to further weave quality improvement into the fabric of the organization's culture. It gave SSMHC's people the tools and techniques to make improvements, created an environment of teamwork, and introduced the concept of improving processes. Using the Baldrige Criteria for Performance Excellence as a business model helped SSMHC to see how various organizational functions should link and to discover gaps in the linkage within its own organization. Baldrige feedback reports identified opportunities that could then be prioritized and the resulting improvements implemented. Overall, the Baldrige model gave a focused approach to what had been scattered improvement efforts. SSM Health Care considers the Baldrige model the best way for an organization to get better faster.},

Case studies, including the development and implementation, of three informatics initiatives at VNSNY are presented on: (1) Quality Scorecards that utilize process, outcomes, cost, and satisfaction measures to assess performance among clinical staff and programs; (2) a tool to identify patients at risk of being hospitalized, and (3) a predictive model that identifies patients who are eligible for physical rehabilitation services. Following a description of these initiatives, we discuss their impact on quality and process indicators, as well as the opportunities and challenges to implementation.},

Our analysis indicates that while Hospital Compare process performance measures are correlated with 30-day mortality for each diagnosis, after we account for unobserved heterogeneity, process of care performance is no longer associated with mortality for any diagnosis. This suggests that the relationship between hospital-level process of care performance and mortality is not causal. Implications for pay-for-performance are discussed.},

With the mandated addition in 2000 of Outcome Assessment and Information Set (OASIS) and outcome-based quality improvement (OBQI), Medicare home health agencies entered a new era of documenting, tracking, and systematically improving quality. OBQI is augmented by the Medicare Quality Improvement Organization (QIO) program, which is now entering the ninth in a series of work assignments, with the tenth scope in the planning stages. Evidence has shown that applied quality improvement methods can drive better outcomes using important metrics, such as acute care hospitalization.

Differences in outcome may be due to case mix, how the data were collected, chance, or quality of care. Health care is only one determinant of health and other factors have important effects on health outcomes, such as nutrition, environment, lifestyle and poverty. The advantages of process measures are that they are more sensitive to differences in the quality of care and they are direct measures of quality. However, outcome measures are of greater intrinsic interest and can reflect all aspects of care, including those that are otherwise difficult to measure such as technical expertise and operator skill. Outcome indicators can be improved if efforts are made to standardize data collection and case mix adjustment systems are developed and validated. It is argued that this is worth doing only where it is likely that variations in health care might lead to significant variations in health outcome and where the occurrence of the outcome is sufficiently common that the outcome indicator will have the power to detect real differences in quality. If these conditions are not met, then alternative strategies such as process measurement and risk management techniques may be more effective at protecting the public from poor quality care.},

This chapter identifies conceptual and methodological issues that make this task difficult, including the confusion between patient perceptions and patient satisfaction and the difficulty of determining whether systematic variations in patient perceptions should be attributed to differences in expectations or actual experiences. We propose a conceptual model to help unravel these knotty issues; review qualitative studies that report directly from patients on how they define quality; provide an overview of how health plans, hospitals, physicians, and health care in general are currently viewed by patients; assess whether and how patient health status and demographic characteristics relate to perceptions of health care quality; and identify where further, or more appropriately designed, research is needed. Our aim is to find out what patients want, need and experience in health care, not what professionals (however well-motivated) believe they need or get. Through the Patient's Eyes (23)},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate effects on patient outcomes of Outcome-Based Quality Improvement (OBQI), a continuous quality improvement methodology for home health care (HHC). DESIGN: A quasi-experimental design with prospective pre/post and study/control components within two multiyear demonstration trials (occurring from 1995 to 2000) in which 73 home health agencies implemented OBQI, receiving several annual cycles of outcome reports to evaluate and enhance patient outcomes. SETTING: New York and 27 other states. PARTICIPANTS: The study involved 157,548 predominantly older adult patients admitted over 3 years to 54 OBQI agencies from 27 states in the National Demonstration Trial, 105,917 patients admitted over 4 years to 19 OBQI agencies in the New York State Trial, and 248,621 patients admitted over 3 years to non-OBQI control agencies in the 27 demonstration states. INTERVENTION: As a clinical management and administrative intervention, OBQI involves collecting, encoding, and transmitting patient-level health status data to a central source that provides each OBQI agency with a risk-adjusted outcome report comparing the agency's patient outcomes with those from a reference population and with its own outcomes from the prior period. Target outcomes are selected and focused plans of action implemented to change care behaviors. Outcome changes are evaluated through the next report cycle. MEASUREMENTS: Outcome measures include hospitalization rates and improvement and stabilization outcome rates in functional, physiological, emotional/behavioral, and cognitive health. RESULTS: For the National and New York State Demonstration Trials, the risk-adjusted relative rates of decline in hospitalization of 22\% and 26\%, respectively, for OBQI patients over the 3-year and 4-year demonstration periods were significant (P {\textless} .001) and unparalleled by considerably smaller rates of decline for the non-OBQI patients in the 27 states. The risk-adjusted rates of improvement in OBQI target outcome measures of health status averaged 5\% to 7\% per year in both demonstration trials and were significantly greater (P {\textless} .05) than analogous improvement rates for nontarget comparison outcomes, which averaged about 1\% per year. CONCLUSION: It is feasible to integrate the programmatic, data collection, data transmission, and outcome enhancement components of OBQI into the day-to-day operations of home health agencies. The aggregate findings and the agency-level evidence available from site-specific communications suggest that OBQI had a pervasive effect on outcome improvement for home health patients. OBQI appears to warrant expansion and refinement in HHC and experimentation in other healthcare settings.},

	abstract = {We reviewed the recent literature on hospital readmissions and found that most of them are believed to be caused by patient frailty and progression of chronic disease. However, from 9\% to 48\% of all readmissions have been judged to be preventable because they were associated with indicators of substandard care during the index hospitalization, such as poor resolution of the main problem, unstable therapy at discharge, and inadequate postdischarge care. Furthermore, randomized prospective trials have shown that 12\% to 75\% of all readmissions can be prevented by patient education, predischarge assessment, and domiciliary aftercare. We conclude that most readmissions seem to be caused by unmodifiable causes, and that, pending an agreed-on method to adjust for confounders, global readmission rates are not a useful indicator of quality of care. However, high readmission rates of patients with defined conditions, such as diabetes and bronchial asthma, may identify quality-of-care problems. A focus on the specific needs of such patients may lead to the creation of more responsive health care systems for the chronically ill.},

Hospitalizations, costs, and some quality-of-care outcomes were measured with claims data for 18 309 patients (n = 178 to 2657 per program) from patients' enrollment through June 2006. A patient survey 7 to 12 months after enrollment provided additional quality-of-care measures.Interventions Nurses provided patient education and monitoring (mostly via telephone) to improve adherence and ability to communicate with physicians. Patients were contacted twice per month on average; frequency varied widely.Main Outcome Measures Hospitalizations, monthly Medicare expenditures, patient-reported and care process indicators.Results Thirteen of the 15 programs showed no significant (P{\textless}.05) differences in hospitalizations; however, Mercy had 0.168 fewer hospitalizations per person per year (90\% confidence interval [CI], −0.283 to −0.054; 17\% less than the control group mean, P=.02) and Charlestown had 0.118 more hospitalizations per person per year (90\% CI, 0.025-0.210; 19\% more than the control group mean, P=.04). None of the 15 programs generated net savings. Treatment group members in 3 programs (Health Quality Partners [HQP], Georgetown, Mercy) had monthly Medicare expenditures less than the control group by 9\% to 14\% (−\$84; 90\% CI, −\$171 to \$4; P=.12; −\$358; 90\% CI, −\$934 to \$218; P=.31; and −\$112; 90\% CI, −\$231 to \$8; P=.12; respectively). Savings offset fees for HQP and Georgetown but not for Mercy; Georgetown was too small to be sustainable. These programs had favorable effects on none of the adherence measures and only a few of many quality of care indicators examined.Conclusions Viable care coordination programs without a strong transitional care component are unlikely to yield net Medicare savings. Programs with substantial in-person contact that target moderate to severe patients can be cost-neutral and improve some aspects of care.Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00627029},

	abstract = {Issues. Countries and international organizations have recently renewed their interest in how health systems perform. This has led to the development of performance indicators for monitoring, assessing, and managing health systems to achieve effectiveness, equity, efficiency, and quality. Although the indicators populate conceptual frameworks, it is often not very clear just what the underlying concepts might be or how effectiveness is conceptualized and measured. Furthermore, there is a gap in the knowledge of how the resultant performance data are used to stimulate improvement and to ensure health care quality.
Addressing the issues. This paper therefore explores, individually, the conceptual bases, effectiveness and its indicators, as well as the quality improvement dynamics of the performance frameworks of the UK, Canada, Australia, US, World Health Organization, and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
Results. We see that they all conceive health and health system performance in one or more supportive frameworks, but differ in concepts and operations. Effectiveness often implies, nationally, the achievement of high quality outcomes of care, or internationally, the efficient achievement of system objectives, or both. Its indicators are therefore mainly outcome and, less so, process measures. The frameworks are linked to a combination of tools and initiatives to stimulate and manage performance and quality improvement.
Conclusions. These dynamics may ensure the proper environment for these conceptual frameworks where, alongside objectives such as equity and efficiency, effectiveness (therefore, quality) becomes the core of health systems performance.},

	abstract = {Background: The availability of patient assessment data collected by all Medicare- and Medicaid-certified nursing homes (NHs) (the Minimum Data Set [MDS]) and home health agencies (HHAs) (the Outcome and Assessment Information Set [OASIS]) provides an opportunity to measure quality of care in these settings. Objective: The objective of this study was to examine methodologic issues encountered as these datasets are used to report the nation's health care in the National Healthcare Quality Report (NHQR) at national and state levels. Findings: Although the reliability of most data elements from MDS and OASIS are considered acceptable in research studies, mixed evidence exists for the reliability and validity of the quality measures themselves. Detection bias can affect the quality measures, particularly for pain and pressure ulcers. Although risk adjustment is used for all measures, effectiveness varies among measures and methods. Additional quality measures such as patient satisfaction, quality of life, and structural measures would be desirable but will require additional data collection efforts. Although the NH measures represent most NH residents, the HHA measures only apply to Medicare and Medicaid patients served by Medicare-certified agencies. Finally, the absence of clinical benchmarks limits the interpretation of the NHQR HHA and NH measures. Conclusions: Further developmental work is needed to address many of these issues to improve the usefulness of these quality measures in future NHQR reports.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study examines the relationships among organizational culture, quality improvement processes and selected outcomes for a sample of up to 61 U. S. hospitals. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SETTING: Primary data were collected from 61 U. S. hospitals (located primarily in the midwest and the west) on measures related to continuous quality improvement/total quality management (CQI/TQM), organizational culture, implementation approaches, and degree of quality improvement implementation based on the Baldrige Award criteria. These data were combined with independently collected data on perceived impact and objective measures of clinical efficiency (i.e., charges and length of stay) for six clinical conditions. STUDY DESIGN: The study involved cross-sectional examination of the named relationships. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: Reliable and valid scales for the organizational culture and quality improvement implementation measures were developed based on responses from over 7,000 individuals across the 61 hospitals with an overall completion rate of 72 percent. Independent data on perceived impact were collected from a national survey and independent data on clinical efficiency from a companion study of managed care. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A participative, flexible, risk-taking organizational culture was significantly related to quality improvement implementation. Quality improvement implementation, in turn, was positively associated with greater perceived patient outcomes and human resource development. Larger-size hospitals experienced lower clinical efficiency with regard to higher charges and higher length of stay, due in part to having more bureaucratic and hierarchical cultures that serve as a barrier to quality improvement implementation. CONCLUSIONS: What really matters is whether or not a hospital has a culture that supports quality improvement work and an approach that encourages flexible implementation. Larger-size hospitals face more difficult challenges in this regard.},

	abstract = {Despite growing interest in measurement of health care quality and patient experience, the current evidence base largely derives from adult health settings, at least in part because of the absence of appropriately developed measurement tools for adolescents. To rectify this, we set out to develop a conceptual framework and a set of indicators to measure the quality of health care delivered to adolescents in hospital.
A conceptual framework was developed from the following four elements: (1) a review of the evidence around what young people perceive as “adolescent-friendly” health care; (2) an exploration with adolescent patients of the principles of patient-centered care; (3) a scoping review to identify core clinical practices around working with adolescents; and (4) a scoping review of existing conceptual frameworks. Using criteria for indicator development, we then developed a set of indicators that mapped to this framework.
Embedded within the notion of patient- and family-centered care, the conceptual framework for adolescent-friendly health care (quality health care for adolescents) was based on the constructs of experience of care (positive engagement with health care) and evidence-informed care. A set of 14 indicators was developed, half of which related to adolescents' and parents' experience of care and half of which related to aspects of evidence-informed care.
The conceptual framework and indicators of quality health care for adolescents set the stage to develop measures to populate these indicators, the next step in the agenda of improving the quality of health care delivered to adolescents in hospital settings.},

	abstract = {Most homes contain potential hazards, and many older people attribute their falls to trips or slips inside the home or immediate home surroundings. However, the existence of home hazards alone is insufficient to cause falls, and the interaction between an older person’s physical abilities and their exposure to environmental stressors appears to be more important. Taking risks or impulsivity may further elevate falls risk. Some studies have found that environmental hazards contribute to falls to a greater extent in older vigorous people than in older frail people. This appears to be due to increased exposure to falls hazards with an increase in the proportion of such falls occurring outside the home. There may also be a non-linear pattern between mobility and falls associated with hazards. Household environmental hazards may pose the greatest risk for older people with fair balance, whereas those with poor balance are less exposed to hazards and those with good mobility are more able to withstand them. Reducing hazards in the home appears not to be an effective falls-prevention strategy in the general older population and those at low risk of falls. Home hazard reduction is effective if targeted at older people with a history of falls and mobility limitations. The effectiveness may depend on the provision of concomitant training for improving transfer abilities and other strategies for effecting behaviour change.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To define the risk factors for recurrent falls in the home-dwelling elderly.
DESIGN: A prospective population-based study covering two years.
SETTING: Five rural municipalities around the city Oulu, northern Finland.
PARTICIPANTS: All home-dwelling elderly persons (N = 1,016) aged 70 years or older living in the municipalities.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The risk factors of recurrent falling by variables related to social status, life changes, housing conditions, health, functional abilities and life style, using cross-tabulations and multivariate analyses.
RESULTS: The recurrent fallers (at least two falls within 365 days after the examination day) consisted of 17 men (6\% of the men) and 71 women (14\%). Logistic regression analyses showed female sex, urinary urgency, frequent fear of falling, dizziness, a poor pulse rate rise 30 seconds after standing up and falling during the previous year to be risk factors for recurrent falls. After the variable representing previous falls had been removed from the analysis, urinary incontinence and a change in housing conditions during the past two years emerged and urinary urgency dropped out of the model.
CONCLUSIONS: Women particularly are a target group for the prevention of falls among the elderly. Urinary urgency and urinary incontinence, fear of falling, dizziness and changes in the housing conditions should be inquired about to identify the elderly at risk for falling and to take preventive interventions. In addition to testing blood pressure changes after standing up, the changes in pulse rate should be determined to identify and treat elderly people who have orthostatic conditions.},

	abstract = {Home health care clinicians seek to provide high quality, safe care in ways that honor patient autonomy and accommodate the individual characteristics of each patient’s home and family. Falls, declining functional abilities, pressure ulcers and nonhealing wounds, and adverse events related to medication administration all have the potential to result in unplanned hospital admissions. Such hospitalizations undermine the achievement of important home health care goals: keeping patients at home and promoting optimal well-being. Nevertheless, the unique characteristics of home health care may make it difficult to use—or necessary to alter—interventions that have been shown to be effective in other settings. Therefore, research on effective practices, conducted in home health care settings, is necessary to support excellent and evidence-based care. In reviewing the extant studies, the authors of this chapter found useful evidence in all selected areas. However, the number of studies was few and many questions remain. Replications of investigations originally conducted in health care settings other than the home, and studies considering home health care-specific issues are needed to support evidence-based clinical decisions. The available evidence suggests that the work environment in which home health care nurses practice may indirectly influence patient outcomes in many areas, and that technology can be used to support positive patient outcomes. Thus, studies that link nurse-related variables to improved care safety and quality are needed, as well as studies that focus directly on patients. The demographics of an aging society will sustain the trend toward home-based care. Home health care practices grounded in careful research will sustain the patients and the clinicians who serve them. Given the focused review of evidence-based studies comprising this chapter, many informative sources of use to the practicing home health care nurse are omitted.

Design: Randomised controlled trial with one year's follow up.
Setting: Community health service at a New Zealand hospital.
Participants: 240 women and men aged 75 years and older.
Intervention: 121 participants received the exercise programme (exercise group) and 119 received usual care (control group); 90\% (211 of 233) completed the trial.
Main outcome measures: Number of falls, number of injuries resulting from falls, costs of implementing the programme, and hospital costs as a result of falls.
Results: Falls were reduced by 46\% (incidence rate ratio 0.54, 95\% confidence interval 0.32 to 0.90). Five hospital admissions were due to injuries caused by falls in the control group and none in the exercise group. The programme cost \$NZ1803 (£523) (at 1998 prices) per fall prevented for delivering the programme and \$NZ155 per fall prevented when hospital costs averted were considered.
Conclusion: A home exercise programme, previously shown to be successful when delivered by a physiotherapist, was also effective in reducing falls when delivered by a trained nurse from within a home health service. Serious injuries and hospital admissions due to falls were also reduced. The programme was cost effective in participants aged 80 years and older compared with younger participants.},

The objective of this study was to investigate patient satisfaction with the quality of services provided before and after the implementation of electronic health records (EHRs) at Primary Health Care Centers (PHCCs) in Kuwait. A self-developed questionnaire was used. A random sampling was used to select 700 subjects. The response rate was 74 percent. The majority of participants (67 percent) were 19 to 34 years of age. Of the participants, 63 percent were female and 92 percent were Kuwaiti nationals. Before EHR implementation, respondents’ disagreement regarding the doctor's carefulness in conducting the examination, uses of medical terminology, explanations for medication given, and time given for a patient was more than 30 percent. Disagreement regarding the rest of the questions related to the patient/physician relationship after EHR implementation was also higher (25 percent to 39 percent).},

Participants met in five discussion tracks: technical framework; research and evaluation; ethics; education, professional training, and workforce development; and sustainability. Participants identified 62 recommendations, which clustered into three key themes related to the need to (1) enhance communication and information sharing within the public health informatics community, (2) improve the consistency of public health informatics through common public health terminologies, rigorous evaluation methodologies, and competency-based training, and (3) promote effective coordination and leadership that will champion and drive the field forward. The agenda and recommendations from the meeting will be disseminated and discussed throughout the public health and informatics communities. Both communities stand to gain much by working together to use these recommendations to further advance the application of information technology to improve health.},

Background: Although home healthcare nurses include clients and family members in decision-making about care, few publications address the nature of interactions among triads of clients, caregivers and nurses in home health care and the association between decision-making and those interactions. Method: The data presented in this paper are a secondary analysis of data originally collected in 1994. The sample included 157 decision-making situations identified from interactions of seven triads of older home healthcare clients, their caregivers and nurses. Qualitative data were collected by participant observation and audiorecording of admission visit interactions among clients, caregivers and nurses. Content analysis, augmented by Ethnograph software, was used to analyse the data. Findings: Coalitions were evident in just eight of the 157 decision-making situations. All of the theoretically possible types of nursing care decisions (programme, operational control, agenda) were observed. Each coalition involved one nursing care decision; two coalitions formed in one triad. Seven coalitions formed between nurse and caregiver against client during two programme and five operational control decisions. One coalition formed between client and caregiver against nurse during an agenda decision. No coalitions formed between client and nurse against caregiver. Conclusions: Although the study sample was small, the findings expand understanding of the relation between types of decisions and formation of coalitions during triadic interactions in home health care, and provided empirical support for a portion of the Theory of Collaborative Decision-Making in Nursing Practice for Triads.

This study examined crucial links between HITs and quality of service provided through an empirical investigation of 252 patients in a hospital-in-the-home unit (HHU) in a Spanish regional hospital. The study sought to test the relationship between HITs and the quality of service using factor analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM) to investigate how HITs mediate effects of organisational learning on quality of service. Findings support the notion that the relationship between organisational learning and quality of service can be mediated by HITs.

	abstract = {Objective
Despite emerging evidence that electronic health records (EHRs) can improve the efficiency and quality of medical care, most physicians in office practice in the United States do not currently use an EHR. We sought to measure the correlates of EHR adoption.
Design
Mailed survey to a stratified random sample of all medical practices in Massachusetts in 2005, with one physician per practice randomly selected for survey.
Measurements
EHR adoption rates.
Results
The response rate was 71\% (1345/1884). Overall, while 45\% of physicians were using an EHR, EHRs were present in only 23\% of practices. In multivariate analysis, practice size was strongly correlated with EHR adoption; 52\% of practices with 7 or more physicians had an EHR, as compared with 14\% of solo practices (adjusted odds ratio, 3.66; 95\% confidence interval, 2.28–5.87). Hospital-based practices (adjusted odds ratio, 2.44; 95\% confidence interval, 1.53–3.91) and practices that teach medical students or residents (adjusted odds ratio, 2.30; 95\% confidence interval, 1.60–3.31) were more likely to have an EHR. The most frequently cited barriers to adoption were start-up financial costs (84\%), ongoing financial costs (82\%), and loss of productivity (81\%).
Conclusions
While almost half of physicians in Massachusetts are using an EHR, fewer than one in four practices in Massachusetts have adopted EHRs. Adoption rates are lower in smaller practices, those not affiliated with hospitals, and those that do not teach medical students or residents. Interventions to expand EHR use must address both financial and non-financial barriers, especially among smaller practices.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To recommend effective strategies for implementing clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). DATA SOURCES: The Research and Development Resource Base in Continuing Medical Education, maintained by the University of Toronto, was searched, as was MEDLINE from January 1990 to June 1996, inclusive, with the use of the MeSH heading "practice guidelines" and relevant text words. STUDY SELECTION: Studies of CPG implementation strategies and reviews of such studies were selected. Randomized controlled trials and trials that objectively measured physicians' performance or health care outcomes were emphasized. DATA EXTRACTION: Articles were reviewed to determine the effect of various factors on the adoption of guidelines. DATA SYNTHESIS: The articles showed that CPG dissemination or implementation processes have mixed results. Variables that affect the adoption of guidelines include qualities of the guidelines, characteristics of the health care professional, characteristics of the practice setting, incentives, regulation and patient factors. Specific strategies fell into 2 categories: primary strategies involving mailing or publication of the actual guidelines and secondary interventional strategies to reinforce the guidelines. The interventions were shown to be weak (didactic, traditional continuing medical education and mailings), moderately effective (audit and feedback, especially concurrent, targeted to specific providers and delivered by peers or opinion leaders) and relatively strong (reminder systems, academic detailing and multiple interventions). CONCLUSIONS: The evidence shows serious deficiencies in the adoption of CPGs in practice. Future implementation strategies must overcome this failure through an understanding of the forces and variables influencing practice and through the use of methods that are practice- and community-based rather than didactic.},

	abstract = {Increasing interest in end users' reactions to health information technology (IT) has elevated the importance of theories that predict and explain health IT acceptance and use. This paper reviews the application of one such theory, the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), to health care. We reviewed 16 data sets analyzed in over 20 studies of clinicians using health IT for patient care. Studies differed greatly in samples and settings, health ITs studied, research models, relationships tested, and construct operationalization. Certain TAM relationships were consistently found to be significant, whereas others were inconsistent. Several key relationships were infrequently assessed. Findings show that TAM predicts a substantial portion of the use or acceptance of health IT, but that the theory may benefit from several additions and modifications. Aside from improved study quality, standardization, and theoretically motivated additions to the model, an important future direction for TAM is to adapt the model specifically to the health care context, using beliefs elicitation methods.},

The in-home crisis intervention service averted the need for hospitalization in 80\% of referred patients presenting for inpatient admission. A two-year analysis, involving more than 600 patients, found nearly four times fewer severe psychiatric relapses requiring readmission among patients triaged by the crisis intervention service, compared to patients hospitalized without going through its service. The service saved approximately 3,347 days of hospital-based psychiatric care over the two-year study period. This program evaluation data, combined with previous research, documents that for the vast majority of hospitalized psychiatric patients, intensive in-home crisis intervention and treatment services are a more effective and cost-efficient form of care.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Use and Acceptance of an Electronic Health Record: Factors Affecting Physician Attitudes Mary Elizabeth Morton Susan Wiedenbeck, Ph.D. and Katherine W. McCain, Ph.D. The benefits of using electronic health records (EHRs) are well-documented; however, a number of implementation barriers have impeded their widespread use. The literature provides evidence of failed clinical system implementations, due to lack of adoption by users. Health care organizations must be prepared to anticipate and manage changes that will accompany implementation of a new information system. As the key coordinator and provider of patient care, physician acceptance of an EHR application will determine the overall success of a product's implementation. The objective of this study was to determine the individual characteristics and sociotechnical factors that may contribute to physician acceptance of an EHR. A hypothesized causal model grounded in Diffusion of Innovations theory and the Technology Acceptance Model was developed using case study and survey methods, and was tested using structural equation modeling (SEM). An online survey was distributed to 802 faculty, fellow and resident physicians in an acute care teaching institution in the southeastern United States. Overall response rate was 29.8\%. The model variables explained over 73\% of the variance in EHR attitude and acceptable model fit was achieved. Individual physician characteristics did not correlate with attitudes in this population. Factors contributing to physician acceptance include: management support, physician involvement in selection and implementation, xiii perceptions of the EHR's impact on physician autonomy, doctor-patient relationship, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. Study participants also expressed concerns about perceptions of the EHR's potential negative impact on clinical workflow and efficiency. Adequate training was not a significant predictor of attitudes. Significant contributions of this study include development of an EHR Acceptance Model for assessing physician attitudes prior to EHR implementation. Other healthcare institutions may find this framework useful for assessing EHR readiness. The findings may aid software developers in designing products to accommodate multiple clinical specialties and user skill levels. The results provide empirical support for a theory about the impact of sociotechnical factors on physician attitudes about EHR adoption.},

	abstract = {Medical care at the end of life consumes 10\% to 12\% of the total health care budget and 27\% of the Medicare budget. Many people claim that increased use of hospice and advance directives and lower use of high-technology interventions for terminally ill patients will produce significant cost savings. However, the studies on cost savings from hospice and advance directives are not definitive. The 3 randomized trials show no savings from these interventions, but either they are too small for confidence in their negative results or their intervention and cost accounting are flawed. The nonrandomized trials of hospice and advance directives show a wide range of savings, from 68\% to none. Five methodological issues obscure the assessment of these studies: (1) selection bias in those patients who use hospice and advance directives, (2) the different time frames of assessing the costs, (3) the limited types of medical costs evaluated, (4) the variability of reporting the savings, and (5) the lack of generalizability of the findings to other patient populations. A more definitive study that assessed patients' end-of-life care preferences, use of hospice and advance directives, and direct and indirect costs would be desirable. In the absence of such a study, the existing data suggest that hospice and advance directives can save between 25\% and 40\% of health care costs during the last month of life, with savings decreasing to 10\% to 17\% over the last 6 months of life and decreasing further to 0\% to 10\% over the last 12 months of life. These savings are less than most people anticipate. Nevertheless, they do indicate that hospice and advance directives should be encouraged because they certainly do not cost more and they provide a means for patients to exercise their autonomy over end-of-life decisions.(JAMA. 1996;275:1907-1914)},

Whereas it is recognised that interpreting services are generally inadequate and inappropriate reliance is placed on family members to interpret, little is known about how nurses working in primary care utilise interpreters to overcome language barriers. The present paper reports on a study examining the utilisation of interpreting services by a range of primary care nurses from the perspectives of the nurses, interpreters and minority ethnic communities. Focus groups were undertaken with five separate groups of district nurses, health visitors, practice nurses, community midwives and specialist nurses, three groups of interpreters from different interpreting services, and five groups of participants from the main community languages in the locality where the study was undertaken (i.e. Arabic, Bengali, Cantonese, Somali and Urdu). Focus group discussions were tape-recorded and subsequently transcribed. Data analysis drew upon the principles of 'framework' analysis. The use of interpreters by primary care nurses varied considerably. Nurses who had received training in using interpreters and who had most control over the timing of patient visits were more likely to use interpreting services. Inadequate training of both nurses and interpreters adversely affected the quality of interaction where interpreters were used. Primary care nurses acted as gatekeepers to interpreting services. Whereas interpreting services were generally perceived to be inadequate, many nurses were accepting of the status quo and prepared to rely on family members to interpret rather than champion the need to improve services.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to use the activity-based costing approach to give a better insight in the actual cost structure of a positron emission tomography procedure (FDG-PET) by defining the constituting components and by simulating the impact of possible resource or practice changes. METHODS: The cost data were obtained from the hospital administration, personnel and vendor interviews as well as from structured questionnaires. A process map separates the process in 16 patient- and non-patient-related activities, to which the detailed cost data are related. One-way sensitivity analyses shows to which degree of uncertainty the different parameters affect the individual cost and evaluate the impact of possible resource or practice changes like the acquisition of a hybrid PET/CT device, the patient throughput or the sales price of a 370MBq (18)F-FDG patient dose. RESULTS: The PET centre spends 73\% of time in clinical activities and the resting time after injection of the tracer (42\%) is the single largest departmental cost element. The tracer cost and the operational time have the most influence on cost per procedure. The analysis shows a total cost per FDG-PET ranging from 859 Euro for a BGO PET camera to 1142 Euro for a 16 slices PET-CT system, with a distribution of the resource costs in decreasing order: materials (44\%), equipment (24\%), wage (16\%), space (6\%) and hospital overhead (10\%). CONCLUSIONS: The cost of FDG-PET is mainly influenced by the cost of the radiopharmaceutical. Therefore, the latter rather than the operational time should be reduced in order to improve its cost-effectiveness.},

Reengineering is classified as a radical approach to organizational change, and shown to complement incremental improvement programs, such as total quality management (TQM). Although the leadership of general managers is critical to BPR success, the enabling role of IT also empowers information systems managers and system analysts. The relevant case study literature is critically reviewed while a BPR initiative in a major Hong Kong bank is examined in detail.

A methodology is proposed to elicit users' needs using a process-oriented analysis, and it is applied to the field of blood transfusion. We defined a process data model, the main components of which are: activities, resources, constrains, guidelines and indicators. Although some aspects of activity, such as "where", "what else", and "why" are poorly represented by the data model alone, this method of requirement elicitation fits the dynamic of data input for the process to be traced.

	doi = {10.4338/ACI-2013-12-RA-0106},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Homecare is an important and effective way of managing chronic illnesses using skilled nursing care in the home. Unlike hospitals and ambulatory settings, clinicians visit patients at home at different times, independent of each other. Twenty-nine percent of 10,000 homecare agencies in the United States have adopted point-of-care EHRs. Yet, relatively little is known about the growing use of homecare EHRs.
OBJECTIVE: Researchers compared workflow, financial billing, and patient outcomes before and after implementation to evaluate the impact of a homecare point-of-care EHR.
METHODS: The design was a pre/post observational study embedded in a mixed methods study. The setting was a Philadelphia-based homecare agency with 137 clinicians. Data sources included: (1) clinician EHR documentation completion; (2) EHR usage data; (3) Medicare billing data; (4) an EHR Nurse Satisfaction survey; (5) clinician observations; (6) clinician interviews; and (7) patient outcomes.
RESULTS: Clinicians were satisfied with documentation timeliness and team communication. Following EHR implementation, 90\% of notes were completed within the 1-day compliance interval (n = 56,702) compared with 30\% of notes completed within the 7-day compliance interval in the pre-implementation period (n = 14,563; OR 19, p {\textless}. 001). Productivity in the number of clinical notes documented post-implementation increased almost 10-fold compared to pre-implementation. Days to Medicare claims fell from 100 days pre-implementation to 30 days post-implementation, while the census rose. EHR implementation impact on patient outcomes was limited to some behavioral outcomes.
DISCUSSION: Findings from this homecare EHR study indicated clinician EHR use enabled a sustained increase in productivity of note completion, as well as timeliness of documentation and billing for reimbursement with limited impact on improving patient outcomes. As EHR adoption increases to better meet the needs of the growing population of older people with chronic health conditions, these results can inform homecare EHR development and implementation.},

To identify whether and how an EHR system can do this most effectively, direct observation was conducted in a residential aged care home on nurses' use of EHR for wound care. The work processes of wound care and its documentation were investigated. Problems in the use of EHR were identified: 1) functional deficiencies of the EHR system which included a lack of functions to remind nurses of the existence of a wound chart, unavailability of an existent function when needed and a lack of sufficient detail in the information provided; 2) a lack of mobile devices to allow nurses to access the EHR system at the point-of-care, resulting in nurses using paper for point-of-care documentation. The findings suggest that continuous improvement in both the EHR system and its management is required to achieve integration of people, task, process and technology for the optimal benefits of EHR.},

These surveys measured priority for transformation, the presence of medical home practice systems, and the presence of various organizational factors and change strategies. Survey response rates were 98\% for the Change Process Capability Questionnaire survey and 92\% for the Physician Practice Connections survey. They showed that 80\% to 100\% of these certified clinics had 15 of the 18 organizational factors important for improving care processes and that 60\% to 90\% had successfully used 16 improvement strategies. Higher priority for this change (P = .001) and use of more strategies (P = .05) were predictive of greater change in systems. Clinics contemplating medical home transformation should consider the factors and strategies identified here and should be sure that such a change is indeed a high priority for them.},

The use of new technology can contribute to improve the healthcare system efficiency.

To measure performance we were inspired by the Lean approach. The results show that medication distribution technology is considered as an effective way to significantly detect medication errors, to allow nurses to focus more on patients and pharmacy to react more rapidly to changes in patient medications.},

This manuscript introduces an 8-dimensional model specifically designed to address the socio-technical challenges involved in design, development, implementation, use, and evaluation of HIT within complex adaptive healthcare systems. The 8 dimensions are not independent, sequential, or hierarchical, but rather are interdependent and interrelated concepts similar to compositions of other complex adaptive systems. Hardware and software computing infrastructure refers to equipment and software used to power, support, and operate clinical applications and devices. Clinical content refers to textual or numeric data and images that constitute the “language” of clinical applications. The human computer interface includes all aspects of the computer that users can see, touch, or hear as they interact with it. People refers to everyone who interacts in some way with the system, from developer to end-user, including potential patient-users. Workflow and communication are the processes or steps involved in assuring that patient care tasks are carried out effectively. Two additional dimensions of the model are internal organizational features (e.g., policies, procedures, and culture) and external rules and regulations, both of which may facilitate or constrain many aspects of the preceding dimensions. The final dimension is measurement and monitoring, which refers to the process of measuring and evaluating both intended and unintended consequences of HIT implementation and use. We illustrate how our model has been successfully applied in real-world complex adaptive settings to understand and improve HIT applications at various stages of development and implementation.},

	abstract = {The Institute of Medicine defines health care quality as increasing "the likelihood of desired health outcomes" using "services  consistent with current professional knowledge." This definition implies that quality measures can be based on either achieving health care outcomes or completing processes that experts agree have been shown by scientific evidence to improve outcomes. Process-based measures are especially suitable when the user needs to know how to improve quality, when provider comparisons show equivalent outcomes but all providers should improve processes, when measures are needed to evaluate health care that is intended to improve long-term outcomes, or when the contribution of individual providers (especially providers who have a small number of cases) needs to be defined. However, many different process-based measures are needed to comprehensively assess quality, and many process-based measures require detailed clinical data currently found only in medical records. Therefore, the expense of abstracting records is a barrier to process-based measurement. Fortunately, large-scale process-based measures are becoming more feasible because the required clinical data are being included in large databases. The merging of existing inpatient and outpatient databases with pharmacy and laboratory databases is an important step toward obtaining data that link all patient admissions, appointments, diagnostic procedures, and prescriptions with diagnoses and test results. Other data that are valuable for process-based measures must still be obtained by abstracting data from records, including clinical findings, patient preferences, and medical and family history. In the future, such data may be added to large databases to create computerized medical records.},

	abstract = {AIM: The aim of this paper is to identify the broad epistemological debates which underpin conflicting statements on 'rigour' and 'good practice' in qualitative research; to relate divergences in statements of 'good practice' in focus group design made by the pre-eminent commentators on focus group methodology to these broader epistemological debates; and to stimulate further reflection on the range of possible uses for focus groups in health services research. Considerations of the analysis of focus group data are beyond the scope of this paper.
DISCUSSION: Focus groups are a popular form of qualitative data collection, and may be defined as a particular form of group interview intended to exploit group dynamics. While qualitative research may be broadly characterized as concerned with exploring people's lived experiences and perspectives in context, it is a heterogeneous field incorporating many theoretical traditions. Consequently, qualitative researchers may be informed by a wide range of assumptions about the nature of knowledge (epistemology). These assumptions, whether implicit or explicit, have important consequences for claims about rigour and 'good practice' in data collection. Thus, while there is broad agreement over the general form of focus groups, statements of 'good practice' in terms of its application are varied. A close reading of texts by the two pre-eminent commentators on the practical application of focus groups identifies differences in 'best practice' focus group design related to their respective epistemological assumptions, and differences principally related to sampling techniques, composition of groups, the perceived role of group interaction and the nature of inference.
CONCLUSION: Explicit consideration of the epistemological basis of divergent statements of 'best practice' in focus group design forces health services researchers to balance the demands of theory with the practicalities of conducting focus group research within complex host organisations; and encourages readers to apply appraisal criteria appropriate to the stated intentions of researchers.},

Five US rural home health agencies of different types participated in the study. All agencies were not-for-profit and served low-income patients in designated health professional shortage areas or medically underserved areas/populations. A prospective treatment group was telemonitored daily in the home during the period 1 October 2006 to 31 May 2009 (n = 1419). An historical control group was selected sequentially backwards from 30 September 2006 (n = 1502). Both groups had home health services for approximately 50 days (P = 0.76). We used logistic regression modelling, with covariate data captured from the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) data set, to assess the effect of group on outcome. Home telemonitoring was found to reduce the odds of any acute care hospitalization (OR = 0.59, P {\textless} 0.001) and to increase the odds of discharge to the community (OR = 1.36, P = 0.003).},

Patients in the control group showed no clear differences in quality of life at the end of the trial. The telehealth group showed a consistent trend towards improved quality of life on several instruments, including the SF-36, the St George Respiratory Questionnaire and the K10 questionnaire; the improvement in the latter was significant. Hospitalizations were reduced in both the control (−19\%) and telehealth group (−25\%). Patient interviews indicated that the technology was acceptable to most patients and their families, including the Māori.

To learn from the experiences of providers that have widely incorporated electronic communication into patient care, we interviewed leaders of twenty-one medical groups that use it extensively with patients. We also interviewed staff in six of those groups. Electronic communication was widely perceived to be a safe, effective, and efficient means of communication that improves patient satisfaction and saves patients time but that increases the volume of physician work unless office visits are reduced. Practice redesign and new payment methods are likely necessary for electronic communication to be more widely used in patient care.},

Low birth rates and rapid increases in the percentages of elderly people make aging and aged care one of the top-priority issues among the national agenda of many countries. The responses of governments have included initiatives to extend productive working lives and promote self-funded retirement; to promote healthy, active aging; and to encourage more care to be delivered in home and community settings. Technology will be a major enabler of these strategies. People requiring health services are increasingly being offered more care in their own homes and community settings as an alternative to hospital admission and to delay or avoid moving into institutional care. Research is providing intelligent technology to enable care in the home as well as to monitor safety, security, and quality. Innovation will provide greater independence and better access to care in their own homes for the elderly, sufferers of chronic illness, and persons with disability and reduce the incidence of hospital admissions and the length of stay when admissions do occur. Technologies will support families and professional caregivers and are expected to reduce costs. This paper reports on developments in technology to support care for the aged in home and community settings.},

	abstract = {Objectives The purpose of this study was threefold. First, we gathered and synthesized the historic literature regarding electronic health record (EHR) adoption rates among physicians in small practices (ten or fewer members). Next, we constructed models to project estimated future EHR adoption trends and timelines. We then determined the likelihood of achieving universal EHR adoption in the near future and articulate how barriers can be overcome in the small and solo practice medical environment.
Design This study used EHR adoption data from six previous surveys of small practices to estimate historic market penetration rates. Applying technology diffusion theory, three future adoption scenarios, optimistic, best estimate, and conservative, are empirically derived.
Measurement EHR adoption parameters, external and internal coefficients of influence, are estimated using Bass diffusion models.
Results All three EHR scenarios display the characteristic diffusion S curve that is indicative that the technology is likely to achieve significant market penetration, given enough time. Under current conditions, EHR adoption will reach its maximum market share in 2024 in the small practice setting.
Conclusion The promise of improved care quality and cost control has prompted a call for universal EHR adoption by 2014. The EHR products now available are unlikely to achieve full diffusion in a critical market segment within the time frame being targeted by policy makers.},

	volume = {33},

	doi = {10.1093/ageing/afh077},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fear of falling may lead to avoidance of activities for seniors, even though they may be able to perform these activities. Specific risk factors for fear of falling that are amenable to change among various populations have been identified within the literature; however, detailed information about the risk factors for fear of falling, specifically among community-based seniors receiving home care services, is limited.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this cross-sectional study was to examine the factors associated with restriction of activity resulting from fear of falling among 2,300 seniors receiving home care services.
PARTICIPANTS: All participants (n = 2,304) in this study were receiving home care services between 1999 and 2001 from a sample of 10 volunteering community-based agencies (Community Care Access Centres) representing the major geographic regions of Ontario, Canada. Community care access centres act as gatekeeping organisations assessing need and contracting out for a broad range of community-based services.
MEASUREMENTS: The Minimum Data Set for Home Care, a comprehensive and standardised assessment tool used to evaluate the needs and ability levels of older adults utilising home care services, covers several key domains, such as service use, function, health and social support. Nurses trained to administer the Minimum Data Set for Home Care assessed each of the participants within their homes.
RESULTS: Of the 2,304 seniors within the study, 41.2\% of participants expressed they restricted their activity for fear of falling. Percentages reporting fear of falling within the literature are considerably lower than the presentfindings, and probably attributable to the frailer, home care population within the present study. In the final logistic regression model, being female, having various impairments/limitations, lack of support and being a multiple faller significantly increased risk of fear of falling, whereas individuals that used antipsychotics and individuals that had Alzheimer's disease were less likely to report restricting their activity.
CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study provide information about a group void in the literature pertaining to activity restriction from fear of falling - community-based seniors receiving home care services. The comprehensive nature of the Minimum Data Set for Home Care allowed for a myriad of factors to be assessed and subsequently analysed with respect to the outcome variable. The inclusion of items on falls, fear of falling, and risk factors for both adverse outcomes means that home care professionals using this instrument will have a unique opportunity to identify and respond to problems that have an important impact on the client's quality of life.},

Two consensus methods commonly adopted in medical, nursing, and health services research--the Delphi process and the nominal group technique (also known as the expert panel)--are described, together with the most appropriate situations for using them; an outline of the process involved in undertaking a study using each method is supplemented by illustrations of the authors' work.

Oncology nurses are of a rare breed. They must have extensive skill, knowledge, compassion, and insight to manage patients with devastating diseases, which sets them apart from other nurses. As managed care changes the timing of discharge from the acute care setting into the home, oncology nurses are assuming more responsibilities relating to appropriate home care and teaching. The following case studies represent examples of oncology care provided by the PCC (the primary nurse). Oncology nurses assist patients and families with various issues such as: listening to underlying concerns, providing physical care, managing pain with patient control analgesia (PCA) when appropriate, and offering comfort care! support during a patient's death and dying process.},

	abstract = {A good understanding of the factors impacting defects in software systems is essential for software practitioners, because it helps them prioritize quality improvement efforts (e.g., testing and code reviews). Defect prediction models are typically built using classification or regression analysis on product and/or process metrics collected at a single point in time (e.g., a release date). However, current defect prediction models only predict if a defect will occur, but not when, which makes the prioritization of software quality improvements efforts difficult. To address this problem, Koru et al. applied survival analysis techniques to a large number of software systems to study how size (i.e., lines of code) influences the probability that a source code module (e.g., class or file) will experience a defect at any given time. Given that 1) the work of Koru et al. has been instrumental to our understanding of the size-defect relationship, 2) the use of survival analysis in the context of defect modelling has not been well studied and 3) replication studies are an important component of balanced scholarly debate, we present a replication study of the work by Koru et al. In particular, we present the details necessary to use survival analysis in the context of defect modelling (such details were missing from the original paper by Koru et al.). We also explore how differences between the traditional domains of survival analysis (i.e., medicine and epidemiology) and defect modelling impact our understanding of the size-defect relationship. Practitioners and researchers considering the use of survival analysis should be aware of the implications of our findings.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Although hospitals are increasingly held accountable for patients’ post-discharge outcomes, giving them incentive to help patients choose high-performing home health agencies, little is known about how quality reports inform decision making. OBJECTIVE We aimed to learn how quality reports are used when choosing home care in one northeast state (Rhode Island) . DESIGN The study consisted of focus groups with home health consumers and structured interviews with hospital case managers. PARTICIPANTS Thirteen consumers and 28 case managers from five hospitals participated in the study. APPROACH We identified key themes and illustrative quotes by audiotaping each session, and then three independent reviewers conducted repeated examination and content analysis. KEY RESULTS No participants were aware of existing state or Medicare home health agency public reports. Case managers provided agency lists to consumers, who routinely asked case managers to tell them which agencies to choose or which were best; but case managers felt unable to directly respond to consumers’ requests for help in making the choice, because they did not have additional information to provide and because they feared violating federal laws requiring freedom of patient choice. Case managers also felt that there was little difference in agency quality, although they acknowledged they might not be aware of problems related to post-hospital care. CONCLUSIONS Home health consumers and hospital case managers were unaware of public reports about home health quality, which limited consumers’ ability to make informed decisions and case mangers’ ability to assist them in that decision-making process. Case managers were otherwise prohibited from recommending specific providers to patients and viewed the ‘patient choice’ laws as restricting their ability to respond to patients’ requests for help in choosing home health agencies. Public reports can be marketed as tools that case managers can use to help patients differentiate among providers, while supporting patient autonomy.},

	abstract = {Accounting for a patient's emotional state is integral in medical care. Tele-health research attests to the challenge clinicians must overcome in assessing patient emotional state when modalities are limited (J. Adv. Nurs. 36(5) 668). The extra effort involved in addressing this challenge requires attention, skill, and time. Large caseloads may not afford tele-home health-care (tele-HHC) clinicians the time and focus necessary to accurately assess emotional states and trends. Unstructured interviews with experienced tele-HHC providers support the introduction of objective indicators of patients’ emotional status in a useful form to enhance patient care. We discuss our contribution to addressing this challenge, which involves building user models not only of the physical characteristics of users—in our case patients—but also models of their emotions. We explain our research in progress on Affective Computing for tele-HHC applications, which includes: developing a system architecture for monitoring and responding to human multimodal affect and emotions via multimedia and empathetic avatars; mapping of physiological signals to emotions and synthesizing the patient's affective information for the health-care provider. Our results using a wireless non-invasive wearable computer to collect physiological signals and mapping these to emotional states show the feasibility of our approach, for which we lastly discuss the future research issues that we have identified.},

Results: Similar levels of skilled service utilization were observed across racial or ethnic groups. Disparities were found in supportive assistance and physical and mental health outcomes. At discharge to self-care, more Black elders had no supportive assistance compared with all other groups; fewer Hispanics and Asians had improved physical functioning compared with Black and White elders. More White elders reported anxiety and depressive symptoms than any other racial or ethnic group. Implications: The findings suggest that racial–ethnic minorities and White elders may have differential needs for mental health and supportive services at discharge from home health care.},

	abstract = {In a pilot study of telemedicine in home health services (HHS) for elderly patients, we implemented and evaluated a telemedicine system with a 33-kbs narrow-band approach to determine its effectiveness in providing quality services. Fifty patients were selected for the study. We found that telemedicine was effective in terms of reducing the number of clinic visits and achieving patient satisfaction. The average number of clinic visits per month was significantly decreased from 0.64 to 0.42 (p\&lt;0.05) after the use of telemedicine. 72\% of patients were satisfied with telemedicine, but only patient location showed a significant difference for patient satisfaction (p\&lt;0.05). Patients in their homes (82\%) were more satisfied than patients in nursing homes (50\%). Of four types of services provided, medical consultation (100\%) was the most highly satisfactory service with telemedicine, followed by physical therapy (83.3\%). Although the satisfaction scores did not indicate a significant difference in the system characteristics, the quality of verbal communication appeared to be a more important factor in influencing patient satisfaction than set-up time or quality of image. A computer-based patient record was also developed to view a patient summary and to document encounters at the patient's home. Since the system is a low-cost approach that is easy to interface with a notebook computer, it can support various other HHSs.},

This situation brings with it a host of human factors and ergonomic (HFE) concerns, both for the home care nurse and the home dwelling patient, that can affect quality of care and patient safety. Many of these concerns are related to the critical home care tasks of information access, communication, and patient self-monitoring and self-management. Currently, a variety of health information technologies (HITs) are being promoted as possible solutions to those problems, but those same technologies bring with them a new set of HFE concerns. This paper reviews the HFE considerations for information access, communication, and patients self-monitoring and self-management, discusses how HIT can potentially mitigate current problems, and explains how the design and implementation of HIT itself requires careful HFE attention.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine whether home telehealth, when integrated with the health facility's electronic medical record system, reduces healthcare costs and improves quality- of-life outcomes relative to usual home healthcare services for elderly high resource users with complex co-morbidities. Study patients were identified through the medical center's database. Intervention patients received home telehealth units that used standard phone lines to communicate with the hospital. FDA-approved peripheral devices monitored vital signs and valid questionnaires were used to evaluate quality-of-life outcomes. Out-of-range data triggered electronic alerts to nurse case managers. (No live video or audio was incorporated in either direction.) Templated progress notes facilitated seamless data entry into the patient's electronic medical record. Participants (n = 104) with complex heart failure, chronic lung disease, and/or diabetes mellitus were randomly assigned to an intervention or control group for 6–12 months. Parametric and nonparametric analyses were performed to compare outcomes for (1) subjective and objective quality-of-life measures, (2) health resource use, and (3) costs. In contrast to the control group, scores for home telehealth subjects showed a statistically significant decrease at 6 months for bed-days-of-care (p {\textless} 0.0001), urgent clinic/emergency room visits (p = 0.023), and A1C levels (p {\textless} 0.0001); at 12 months for cognitive status (p {\textless} 0.028); and at 3 months for patient satisfaction (p {\textless} 0.001). Functional levels and patient-rated health status did not show a significant difference for either group. Integrating home telehealth with the healthcare institution's electronic database significantly reduces resource use and improves cognitive status, treatment compliance, and stability of chronic disease for homebound elderly with common complex co-morbidities.},

	abstract = {SummaryObjective
The purpose of this paper is to give an overview about the state of the art in research on home telehealth in an international perspective.
Method
The study is based on a review of the scientific literature published between 1990 and 2003 and retrieved via Medline in January/February 2004. All together, the abstracts of 578 publications have been analyzed.
Results
The majority of publications (44\%) comes from the United States, followed by UK and Japan. Most publications deal with vital sign parameter (VSP) measurement and audio/video consultations (“virtual visits”). Publications about IT tools for improved information access and communication as well as decision support for staff, patients and relatives are relatively sparse. Clinical application domains are mainly chronic diseases, the elderly population and paediatrics.
Conclusions
Internationally, we observe a trend towards tools and services not only for professionals but also for patients and citizens. However, their impact on the patient–provider relationship and their design for special user groups, such as elderly and/or disabled needs to be further explored. In general, evaluation studies are rare and further research is critical to determine the impacts and benefits, and limitations, of potential solutions and to overcome a number of hinders and restrictions, such as-
the lack of standards to combine incompatible information systems;
-
the lack of an evaluation framework considering legal, ethical, organisational, clinical, usability and technical aspects;
-
the lack of proper guidelines for practical implementation of home telehealth solutions.},

A randomized controlled trial was established using three groups. The first group, control group C, received traditional skilled nursing care at home. The second group, video intervention group V, received traditional skilled nursing care at home and virtual visits using videoconferencing technology. The third group, monitoring intervention group M, received traditional skilled nursing care at home, virtual visits using videoconferencing technology, and physiologic monitoring for their underlying chronic condition.   Discharge to a higher level of care (hospital, nursing home) within 6 months of study participation was 42\% for C subjects, 21\% for V subjects, and 15\% for M subjects. There was no difference in mortality between the groups. Morbidity, as evaluated by changes in the knowledge, behavior and status scales of the Omaha Assessment Tool, showed no differences between groups except for increased scores for activities of daily living at study discharge in the V and M groups. The average visit costs were \$48.27 for face-to-face home visits, \$22.11 for average virtual visits (video group), and \$32.06 and \$38.62 for average monitoring group visits for congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease subjects, respectively.   This study has demonstrated that virtual visits between a skilled home healthcare nurse and chronically ill patients at home can improve patient outcome at lower cost than traditional skilled face-to-face home healthcare visits.},

Its model is constructed from a systemic, comprehensive literature review and analysis. Taking into account how cultural competence is viewed by other disciplines (medicine, psychology, education, and social work), a comprehensive definition, antecedents, and consequences of cultural competence in nursing are described and diagrammed. Additionally, two model cases and future implications are discussed. The broader American society is composed of a mosaic of discrete cultural groups existing within the context of their values and identities. Those distinct cultures affect each patient’s ways of thinking and his or her perceptions on health care and health behaviors. The proposed model of cultural competence provides a theoretical guide for developing strategies to achieve culturally competent care in nursing practice and research.},

	abstract = {Between July 2003 and December 2007, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) introduced a national home telehealth program, Care Coordination/Home Telehealth (CCHT). Its purpose was to coordinate the care of veteran patients with chronic conditions and avoid their unnecessary admission to long-term institutional care. Demographic changes in the veteran population necessitate VHA increase its noninstitutional care (NIC) services 100\% above its 2007 level to provide care for 110,000 NIC patients by 2011. By 2011, CCHT will meet 50\% of VHA’s anticipated NIC provision. CCHT involves the systematic implementation of health informatics, home telehealth, and disease management technologies. It helps patients live independently at home. Between 2003 and 2007, the census figure (point prevalence) for VHA CCHT patients increased from 2,000 to 31,570 (1,500\% growth). CCHT is now a routine NIC service provided by VHA to support veteran patients with chronic conditions as they age. CCHT patients are predominantly male (95\%) and aged 65 years or older. Strict criteria determine patient eligibility for enrollment into the program and VHA internally assesses how well its CCHT programs meet standardized clinical, technology, and managerial requirements. VHA has trained 5,000 staff to provide CCHT. Routine analysis of data obtained for quality and performance purposes from a cohort of 17,025 CCHT patients shows the benefits of a 25\% reduction in numbers of bed days of care, 19\% reduction in numbers of hospital admissions, and mean satisfaction score rating of 86\% after enrollment into the program. The cost of CCHT is \$1,600 per patient per annum, substantially less than other NIC programs and nursing home care. VHA’s experience is that an enterprise-wide home telehealth implementation is an appropriate and cost-effective way of managing chronic care patients in both urban and rural settings.},

The authors identify nine major cultural competency techniques: interpreter services, recruitment and retention policies, training, coordinating with traditional healers, use of community health workers, culturally competent health promotion, including family/community members, immersion into another culture, and administrative and organizational accommodations. The conceptual model shows how these techniques could theoretically improve the ability of health systems and their clinicians to deliver appropriate services to diverse populations, thereby improving outcomes and reducing disparities. The authors conclude that while there is substantial research evidence to suggest that cultural competency should in fact work, health systems have little evidence about which cultural competency techniques are effective and less evidence on when and how to implement them properly.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES:  To determine: 1) whether racial and ethnic differences exist in patients’ perceptions of primary care provider (PCP) and general health care system–related bias and cultural competence; and 2) whether these differences are explained by patient demographics, source of care, or patient-provider communication variables. DESIGN:  Cross-sectional telephone survey. SETTING:  The Commonwealth Fund 2001 Health Care Quality Survey. SUBJECTS:  A total of 6,299 white, African-American, Hispanic, and Asian adults. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:  Interviews were conducted using random-digit dialing; oversampling respondents from communities with high racial/ethnic minority concentrations; and yielding a 54.3\% response rate. Main outcomes address respondents’ perceptions of their PCPs’ and health care system–related bias and cultural competence; adjusted probabilities (Pr) are reported for each ethnic group. Most racial/ethnic differences in perceptions of PCP bias and cultural competence were explained by demographics, source of care, and patient–physician communication variables. In contrast, racial/ethnic differences in patient perceptions of health care system–wide bias and cultural competence persisted even after controlling for confounders: African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians remained more likely than whites (P {\textless} .001) to perceive that: 1) they would have received better medical care if they belonged to a different race/ethnic group (Pr 0.13, Pr 0.08, Pr 0.08, and Pr 0.01, respectively); and 2) medical staff judged them unfairly or treated them with disrespect based on race/ethnicity (Pr 0.06, Pr 0.04, Pr 0.06, and Pr 0.01, respectively) and how well they speak English (Pr 0.09, Pr 0.06, Pr 0.06, and Pr 0.03, respectively). CONCLUSION:  While demographics, source of care, and patient–physician communication explain most racial and ethnic differences in patient perceptions of PCP cultural competence, differences in perceptions of health care system–wide bias and cultural competence are not fully explained by such factors. Future research should include closer examination of the sources of cultural bias in the US medical system.},

A central finding was that telehealth studies to date have not used socio-economic indicators consistently. However, specific telehealth applications have been shown to offer significant socio-economic benefit, to patients and families, health-care providers and the health-care system. The main benefits identified were: increased access to health services, cost-effectiveness, enhanced educational opportunities, improved health outcomes, better quality of care, better quality of life and enhanced social support. Although the review found a number of areas of socio-economic benefit, there is the continuing problem of limited generalizability.},

Based on a review of the relevant literature, the authors develop a definition of cultural competence, identify key components for intervention, and describe a practical framework for implementation of measures to address racial/ethnic disparities in health and health care. METHODS: The authors conducted a literature review of academic, foundation, and government publications focusing on sociocultural barriers to care, the level of the health care system at which a given barrier occurs, and cultural competence efforts that address these barriers. RESULTS: Sociocultural barriers to care were identified at the organizational (leadership/workforce), structural (processes of care), and clinical (provider-patient encounter) levels. A framework of cultural competence interventions--including minority recruitment into the health professions, development of interpreter services and language-appropriate health educational materials, and provider education on cross-cultural issues--emerged to categorize strategies to address racial/ethnic disparities in health and health care. CONCLUSIONS: Demographic changes anticipated over the next decade magnify the importance of addressing racial/ethnic disparities in health and health care. A framework of organizational, structural, and clinical cultural competence interventions can facilitate the elimination of these disparities and improve care for all Americans.},

	abstract = {Southern Europe is exposed to anthropogenic and natural forest fires. These result in loss of lives, goods and infrastructure, but also deteriorate the natural environment and degrade ecosystems. The early detection and combating of such catastrophes requires the use of a decision support system (DSS) for emergency management. The current literature reports on a series of efforts aimed to deliver DSSs for the management of the forest fires by utilising technologies like remote sensing and geographical information systems (GIS), yet no integrated system exists.

This manuscript presents the results of scientific research aiming to the development of a DSS for managing forest fires. The system provides a series of software tools for the assessment of the propagation and combating of forest fires based on Arc/Info, ArcView, Arc Spatial Analyst, Arc Avenue, and Visual C++ technologies. The system integrates GIS technologies under the same data environment and utilises a common user interface to produce an integrated computer system based on semi-automatic satellite image processing (fuel maps), socio-economic risk modelling and probabilistic models that would serve as a useful tool for forest fire prevention, planning and management. Its performance has been demonstrated via real time up-to-date accurate information on the position and evolution of the fire. The system can assist emergency assessment, management and combating of the incident. A site demonstration and validation has been accomplished for the island of Evoia, Greece, an area particularly vulnerable to forest fires due to its ecological characteristics and prevailing wind patterns.},

RFID devices commonly are attached to persons or to moveable objects so that the objects can be tracked by using fixed readers (special-purpose radio receivers) at different locations. In this project, we explore the "flip side" of this practice. Our concept is that detection of RFID devices in known, fixed locations by a moving reader provides a precise indication of location for tracking the person or moving object that is carrying the reader. This information can then be used to correct for any errors of an inertial tracking system.},

	abstract = {In mid-1994, non-Kuwaiti expatriates constituted 61.7\% of the total population of Kuwait (1.75 million). Despite this numerical majority, non-Kuwaitis exist as a social minority. Non-Kuwaitis may be grouped into three broad categories along ethnic/nationality lines into Bidoon (without nationality), Arabs, and Asians. The objective of this paper was to compare the relative accessibility of the various groups to health care services in Kuwait.
The study is based on data collected as part of a survey of 2184 Emergency Room (ER) users in January-February 1993. All patients attending the hospital ERs between 7:30 am and 9:00 pm were interviewed about their reasons for coming to the ER instead of going to the primary health care (PHC) centres, as required. The major reason given was the low accessibility of the PHCs.
Compared to Kuwaiti nationals, 92\% of whom were registered at the PHC centres, only 62\% of the Arabs and 39\% of the Asians were registered. Multiple logistic regression of the factors in registration indicated that nationality was the most important reason for lack of registration, with Asians only about one-quarter as likely to be registered as Kuwaitis. Also, people who had been in Kuwait for shorter durations ({\textless}5 years) were less likely to be registered than the Kuwaiti nationals or expatriates who had been here for 10 years or longer. In the absence of registration at the PHC centre, the civil identification card (ID) may be used as a valid means to enter the health system. Among the Arabs and Asians, 22\% and 29\% did not have a civil ID card. Thus, for many expatriates, the hospital ER, which does not provide the necessary follow-up care is often the only source of health care available.},

	abstract = {Background
mHealth is enjoying considerable interest and private investment in the United States. A small but growing body of evidence indicates some promise in supporting healthy behavior change and self-management of long-term conditions. The unique benefits mobile phones bring to health initiatives, such as direct access to health information regardless of time or location, may create specific issues for the implementation of such initiatives. Other issues may be shared with general health information technology developments.

Objective
To determine the important issues facing the implementation of mHealth from the perspective of those within the US health system and those working in mHealth in the United States.

Methods
Semistructured interviews were conducted with 27 key informants from across the health and mHealth sectors in the United States. Interviewees were approached directly following an environmental scan of mHealth in the United States or recommendation by those working in mHealth.

Results
The most common issues were privacy and data security, funding, a lack of good examples of the efficacy and cost effectiveness of mHealth in practice, and the need for more high-quality research. The issues are outlined and categorized according to the environment within which they predominantly occur: policy and regulatory environments; the wireless industry; the health system; existing mHealth practice; and research.

Conclusions
Many of these issues could be addressed by making the most of the current US health reform environment, developing a strategic and coordinated approach, and seeking to improve mHealth practice.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the operational and financial efficacy of sending short message service (SMS) text message reminders to the mobile telephones of patients with scheduled outpatient clinic appointments.
DESIGN: Cohort study with historical control.
SETTING: Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria.
PATIENTS: Patients who gave a mobile telephone contact number and were scheduled to attend an outpatient clinic at the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne in October, November and December 2004 (trial group) or in October, November and December 2003 (historical control group).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Failure-to-attend (FTA) rate compared between the trial group, whose members were sent a reminder, and the historical control group, whose members were not sent a reminder. Financial benefits versus cost of sending reminders.
RESULTS: 22,658 patients with a mobile telephone contact number scheduled to attend an outpatient clinic appointment in October, November and December 2004 were sent an SMS reminder; 20,448 (90.2\%) of these patients attended their appointment. The control group included 22,452 patients with a mobile telephone contact number scheduled to attend an appointment, with 18,073 (80.5\%) patients attending. The FTA rate was significantly lower in the trial group than in the historical control group (9.8\% v 19.5\%; P {\textless} 0.001). The cost of sending the SMS reminders was small compared with the increase in patient revenue and associated benefits generated as a result of improved attendance.
CONCLUSIONS: The observed reduction in FTA rate was in line with that found using traditional reminder methods and a prior pilot study using SMS. The FTA reduction coupled with the increase in patient revenue suggests that reminding patients using SMS is a very cost effective approach for improving patient attendance.},

	abstract = {AIMS: To assess Sweet Talk, a text-messaging support system designed to enhance self-efficacy, facilitate uptake of intensive insulin therapy and improve glycaemic control in paediatric patients with Type 1 diabetes.
METHODS: One hundred and twenty-six patients fulfilled the eligibility criteria; Type 1 diabetes for {\textgreater} 1 year, on conventional insulin therapy, aged 8-18 years. Ninety-two patients were randomized to conventional insulin therapy (n = 28), conventional therapy and Sweet Talk (n = 33) or intensive insulin therapy and Sweet Talk (n = 31). Goal-setting at clinic visits was reinforced by daily text-messages from the Sweet Talk software system, containing personalized goal-specific prompts and messages tailored to patients' age, sex and insulin regimen.
RESULTS: HbA(1c) did not change in patients on conventional therapy without or with Sweet Talk (10.3 +/- 1.7 vs. 10.1 +/- 1.7\%), but improved in patients randomized to intensive therapy and Sweet Talk (9.2 +/- 2.2\%, 95\% CI -1.9, -0.5, P {\textless} 0.001). Sweet Talk was associated with improvement in diabetes self-efficacy (conventional therapy 56.0 +/- 13.7, conventional therapy plus Sweet Talk 62.1 +/- 6.6, 95\% CI +2.6, +7.5, P = 0.003) and self-reported adherence (conventional therapy 70.4 +/- 20.0, conventional therapy plus Sweet Talk 77.2 +/- 16.1, 95\% CI +0.4, +17.4, P = 0.042). When surveyed, 82\% of patients felt that Sweet Talk had improved their diabetes self-management and 90\% wanted to continue receiving messages.
CONCLUSIONS: Sweet Talk was associated with improved self-efficacy and adherence; engaging a classically difficult to reach group of young people. While Sweet Talk alone did not improve glycaemic control, it may have had a role in supporting the introduction of intensive insulin therapy. Scheduled, tailored text messaging offers an innovative means of supporting adolescents with diabetes and could be adapted for other health-care settings and chronic diseases.},

We assessed the effect of an automated smoking cessation programme delivered via mobile phone text messaging on continuous abstinence, which was biochemically verified at 6 months.
METHODS: In this single-blind, randomised trial, undertaken in the UK, smokers willing to make a quit attempt were randomly allocated, using an independent telephone randomisation system, to a mobile phone text messaging smoking cessation programme (txt2stop), comprising motivational messages and behavioural-change support, or to a control group that received text messages unrelated to quitting. The system automatically generated intervention or control group texts according to the allocation. Outcome assessors were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was self-reported continuous smoking abstinence, biochemically verified at 6 months. All analyses were by intention to treat. This study is registered, number ISRCTN 80978588.
FINDINGS: We assessed 11,914 participants for eligibility. 5800 participants were randomised, of whom 2915 smokers were allocated to the txt2stop intervention and 2885 were allocated to the control group; eight were excluded because they were randomised more than once. Primary outcome data were available for 5524 (95\%) participants. Biochemically verified continuous abstinence at 6 months was significantly increased in the txt2stop group (10·7\% txt2stop vs 4·9\% control, relative risk [RR] 2·20, 95\% CI 1·80-2·68; p{\textless}0·0001). Similar results were obtained when participants that were lost to follow-up were treated as smokers (268 [9\%] of 2911 txt2stop vs 124 [4\%] of 2881 control [RR 2·14, 95\% CI 1·74-2·63; p{\textless}0·0001]), and when they were excluded (268 [10\%] of 2735 txt2stop vs 124 [4\%] of 2789 control [2·20, 1·79-2·71; p{\textless}0·0001]). No significant heterogeneity was shown in any of the prespecified subgroups.
INTERPRETATION: The txt2stop smoking cessation programme significantly improved smoking cessation rates at 6 months and should be considered for inclusion in smoking cessation services.

DATA SOURCE: The 2011 Physician Workflow study, representative of U.S. office-based physicians.
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional data were used to examine the association of EHR use with enhanced patient care overall and nine specific clinical benefits.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Most physicians with EHRs reported EHR use enhanced patient care overall (78 percent), helped them access a patient's chart remotely (81 percent), and alerted them to a potential medication error (65 percent) and critical lab values (62 percent). Between 30 and 50 percent of physicians reported that EHR use was associated with clinical benefits related to providing recommended care, ordering appropriate tests, and facilitating patient communication. Using EHRs that met Meaningful Use criteria and having 2 or more years of EHR experience were independently associated with reported benefits. Physicians with EHRs meeting Meaningful Use criteria and longer EHR experience were most likely to report benefits across all 10 measures.
CONCLUSIONS: Physicians reported EHR use enhanced patient care overall. Clinical benefits were most likely to be reported by physicians using EHRs meeting Meaningful Use criteria and longer EHR experience.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT
The US Federal Government is investing up to \$29 billion in incentives for meaningful use of electronic health records (EHRs). However, the effect of EHRs on ambulatory quality is unclear, with several large studies finding no effect.

OBJECTIVE
To determine the effect of EHRs on ambulatory quality in a community-based setting.

DESIGN
Cross-sectional study, using data from 2008.

SETTING
Ambulatory practices in the Hudson Valley of New York, with a median practice size of four physicians.

PARTICIPANTS
We included all general internists, pediatricians and family medicine physicians who: were members of the Taconic Independent Practice Association, had patients in a data set of claims aggregated across five health plans, and had at least 30 patients per measure for at least one of nine quality measures selected by the health plans.

IINTERVENTION
Adoption of an EHR.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
We compared physicians using EHRs to physicians using paper on performance for each of the nine quality measures, using t-tests. We also created a composite quality score by standardizing performance against a national benchmark and averaging standardized performance across measures. We used generalized estimation equations, adjusting for nine physician characteristics.

KEY RESULTS
We included 466 physicians and 74,618 unique patients. Of the physicians, 204 (44 \%) had adopted EHRs and 262 (56 \%) were using paper. Electronic health record use was associated with significantly higher quality of care for four of the measures: hemoglobin A1c testing in diabetes, breast cancer screening, chlamydia screening, and colorectal cancer screening. Effect sizes ranged from 3 to 13 percentage points per measure. When all nine measures were combined into a composite, EHR use was associated with higher quality of care (sd 0.4, p = 0.008).

CONCLUSIONS
This is one of the first studies to find a positive association between EHRs and ambulatory quality in a community-based setting.},

All studies were independently assessed for quality. All data was abstracted, graded, and reviewed by 2 different reviewers.Results:One hundred forty-six eligible articles were identified including 121 RCTs. Studies were very heterogeous and of variable quality.Four of five asthma care studies found significant positive impact of a CHI application on at least one healthcare process measure.In terms of the impact of CHI on intermediate health outcomes, significant positive impact was demonstrated in at least one intermediate health outcome of; all three identified breast cancer studies, 89 percent of 32 diet, exercise, physical activity, not obesity studies, all 7 alcohol abuse studies, 58 percent of 19 smoking cessation studies, 40 percent of 12 obesity studies, all 7 diabetes studies, 88 percent of 8 mental health studies, 25 percent of 4 asthma/COPD studies, and one of two menopause/HRT utilization studies. Thirteen additional single studies were identified and each found evidence of significant impact of a CHI application on one or more intermediate outcomes.Eight studies evaluated the effect of CHI on the doctor patient relationship. Five of these studies demonstrated significant positive impact of CHI on at least one aspect of the doctor patient relationship.In terms of the impact of CHI on clinical outcomes, significant positive impact was demonstrated in at least one clinical outcome of; one of three breast cancer studies, four of five diet, exercise, or physical activity studies, all seven mental health studies, all three identified diabetes studies. No studies included in this review found any evidence of consumer harm attributable to a CHI application.Evidence was insufficient to determine the economic impact of CHI applications.Conclusions:Despite study heterogeneity, quality variability, and some data paucity, available literature suggests that select CHI applications may effectively engage consumers, enhance traditional clinical interventions, and improve both intermediate and clinical health outcomes.},

	abstract = {Home Care (HC) assistance is emerging as an effective and efficient alternative to institutionalized care, especially for the case of senior patients that present multiple co-morbidities and require life long treatments under continuous supervision. The care of such patients requires the definition of specially tailored treatments and their delivery involves the coordination of a team of professionals from different institutions, requiring the management of many kinds of knowledge (medical, organizational, social and procedural). The K4Care project aims to assist the HC of elderly patients by proposing a standard HC model and implementing it in a knowledge-driven e-health platform aimed to support the provision of HC services. This paper focuses on two knowledge-based personalization aspects incorporated in the platform that aim to overcome the difficulties of HC delivery. The first one is the assistance to medical practitioners in the process of defining a customized treatment adjusted to the medical and social conditions of a particular patient in order to consider multiple co-morbidities. The second one is the possibility of tailoring the profiles of the care professionals according to the medical and organizational daily requirements in order to allow a flexible care delivery. Those two aspects, guided by the knowledge explicitly represented in the platform, play a crucial role in the medical and social acceptance of this kind of e-health systems. The paper also includes a real case study designed and tested by healthcare professionals and includes encouraging results from the test of the platform in a real health care environment in the city of Pollenza (Italy).},

	abstract = {Objective To assess physicians' attitudes toward health information exchange (HIE) and physicians' willingness to pay to participate in HIE.
Design We conducted a cross-sectional mail survey of 1296 licensed physicians (77\% response rate) in Massachusetts in 2007.
Measurements Perceptions of the potential effects of HIE on healthcare costs, quality of care, clinicians' time, patients' privacy concerns, and willingness to pay for HIE.
Results After excluding 253 physicians who did not see any outpatients, we analyzed 1043 responses. Overall, 70\% indicated that HIE would reduce costs, while 86\% said it would improve quality and 76\% believed that it would save time. On the other hand, 16\% reported being very concerned about HIE's effect on privacy, while 55.0\% were somewhat concerned and 29\% not at all concerned. Slightly more than half of the physicians (54\%) said they would be willing to pay an unspecified monthly fee to participate in HIE, but only 37\% said they would be willing to pay \$150 per month for it. Primary care physicians and those in larger practices tended to have more positive attitudes toward HIE.
Conclusions Physicians perceive that HIE will have generally positive effects, though a considerable fraction harbor concerns about privacy. While physicians may be willing to participate in HIE, they are not consistently willing to pay to participate. HIE business models that require substantial physician subscription fees may face significant challenges.},

	abstract = {Objective To examine the financial impact health information exchange (HIE) in emergency departments (EDs).
Materials and Methods We studied all ED encounters over a 13-month period in which HIE data were accessed in all major emergency departments Memphis, Tennessee. HIE access encounter records were matched with similar encounter records without HIE access. Outcomes studied were ED-originated hospital admissions, admissions for observation, laboratory testing, head CT, body CT, ankle radiographs, chest radiographs, and echocardiograms. Our estimates employed generalized estimating equations for logistic regression models adjusted for admission type, length of stay, and Charlson co-morbidity index. Marginal probabilities were used to calculate changes in outcome variables and their financial consequences.
Results HIE data were accessed in approximately 6.8\% of ED visits across 12 EDs studied. In 11 EDs directly accessing HIE data only through a secure Web browser, access was associated with a decrease in hospital admissions (adjusted odds ratio (OR)=0.27; p{\textless}0001). In a 12th ED relying more on print summaries, HIE access was associated with a decrease in hospital admissions (OR=0.48; p{\textless}0001) and statistically significant decreases in head CT use, body CT use, and laboratory test ordering.
Discussion Applied only to the study population, HIE access was associated with an annual cost savings of \$1.9 million. Net of annual operating costs, HIE access reduced overall costs by \$1.07 million. Hospital admission reductions accounted for 97.6\% of total cost reductions.
Conclusion Access to additional clinical data through HIE in emergency department settings is associated with net societal saving.},

Health information exchange makes this possible.

Here we present an overview of six different ways in which HIE can improve patient safety—improved medication information processing, improved laboratory information processing, improved radiology information processing, improved communication among providers, improved communication between patients and providers, and improved public health information processing. Within the area of improved medication information processing we discuss drug-allergy information processing, drug–dose information processing, drug–drug information processing, drug-diagnosis information processing, and drug–gene information processing. We also briefly discuss HIE and decreased patient safety as well as standards and completeness of information for HIE and patient safety.},

Congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and chronic wound-care patients receiving skilled home nursing care were randomized into control (standard home health care, HHC) and two intervention (standard care plus video conferencing/Internet access; the above plus physiological monitoring) groups. Virtual visits (VVs), consisting of two-way audio and video interactions between the central site HHC nurse and the subject at home, were compared for technical quality and clinical usefulness by the HHC nurses who performed the VVs. Subject perception of telehomecare and satisfaction with their HHC were assessed over the course of the project. There were a total of 567 virtual and 1,057 actual visits conducted for the 53 subjects completing the study. The technical quality of VVs were rated at 94.7\%. They were considered to be as useful as actual visits in 90.7\% of cases. Subject telehomecare perception increased after experiencing the process. All subjects were satisfied with their HHC; satisfaction increased with an increasing level of telehomecare intervention. Subjects receiving physiological monitoring and video conferencing/Internet access in addition to standard care were most satisfied with their care. VVs can be conducted over POTS. Patients can use telehomecare with moderate levels of training. These programs can provide timely and quality home health nursing care with VVs augmenting traditional home visits.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many believe that computerization will improve health care quality, reduce costs, and increase administrative efficiency. However, no previous studies have examined computerization's cost and quality impacts at a diverse national sample of hospitals.
METHODS: We linked data from an annual survey of computerization at approximately 4000 hospitals for the period from 2003 to 2007 with administrative cost data from Medicare Cost Reports and cost and quality data from the 2008 Dartmouth Health Atlas. We calculated an overall computerization score and 3 subscores based on 24 individual computer applications, including the use of computerized practitioner order entry and electronic medical records. We analyzed whether more computerized hospitals had lower costs of care or administration, or better quality. We also compared hospitals included on a list of the "100 Most Wired" with others.
RESULTS: More computerized hospitals had higher total costs in bivariate analyses (r=0.06, P=.001) but not multivariate analyses (P=.69). Neither overall computerization scores nor subscores were consistently related to administrative costs, but hospitals that increased computerization faster had more rapid administrative cost increases (P=.0001). Higher overall computerization scores correlated weakly with better quality scores for acute myocardial infarction (r=0.07, P=.003), but not for heart failure, pneumonia, or the 3 conditions combined. In multivariate analyses, more computerized hospitals had slightly better quality. Hospitals on the "Most Wired" list performed no better than others on quality, costs, or administrative costs.
CONCLUSION: As currently implemented, hospital computing might modestly improve process measures of quality but does not reduce administrative or overall costs.},

	abstract = {Objective Electronic health records (EHRs) have the potential to advance the quality of care, but studies have shown mixed results. The authors sought to examine the extent of EHR usage and how the quality of care delivered in ambulatory care practices varied according to duration of EHR availability.
Methods The study linked two data sources: a statewide survey of physicians' adoption and use of EHR and claims data reflecting quality of care as indicated by physicians' performance on widely used quality measures. Using four years of measurement, we combined 18 quality measures into 6 clinical condition categories. While the survey of physicians was cross-sectional, respondents indicated the year in which they adopted EHR. In an analysis accounting for duration of EHR use, we examined the relationship between EHR adoption and quality of care.
Results The percent of physicians reporting adoption of EHR and availability of EHR core functions more than doubled between 2000 and 2005. Among EHR users in 2005, the average duration of EHR use was 4.8 years. For all 6 clinical conditions, there was no difference in performance between EHR users and non-users. In addition, for these 6 clinical conditions, there was no consistent pattern between length of time using an EHR and physicians performance on quality measures in both bivariate and multivariate analyses.
Conclusions In this cross-sectional study, we found no association between duration of using an EHR and performance with respect to quality of care, although power was limited. Intensifying the use of key EHR features, such as clinical decision support, may be needed to realize quality improvement from EHRs. Future studies should examine the relationship between the extent to which physicians use key EHR functions and their performance on quality measures over time.},

To test the effectiveness of two interventions designed to improve the adoption of evidence-based practices by home health nurses caring for heart failure (HF) patients.Data Sources/Study Setting. Information on nurse practices was abstracted from the clinical records of patients admitted between June 2000 and November 2001 to the care of 354 study nurses at a large, urban, nonprofit home care agency.Study Design. The study employed a randomized design with nurses assigned to usual care or one of two intervention groups upon identification of an eligible patient. The basic intervention was a one-time e-mail reminder highlighting six HF-specific clinical recommendations. The augmented intervention consisted of the initial e-mail reminder supplemented by provider prompts, patient education material, and clinical nurse specialist outreach.Data Collection. At each home health visit provided by a study nurse to an eligible HF patient during the 45-day follow-up period, a structured chart abstraction tool was used to collect information on whether the nurse provided the care practices highlighted in the e-mail reminder.Principal Findings. Both the basic and the augmented interventions greatly increased the practice of evidence-based care, according to patient records, in the areas of patient assessment and instructions about HF disease management. While not all results were statistically significant at conventional levels, intervention effects were positive in virtually all cases and effect magnitudes frequently were large.Conclusions. The results of this randomized trial strongly support the efficacy of just-in-time evidence-based reminders as a means of changing clinical practice among home health nurses who are geographically dispersed and spend much of their time in the field.},

The respondents overwhelmingly stated that they had the organizational resources necessary to use the videophone and that it was easy to operate. Despite initial enthusiasm, leaders in the hospice agency did not endorse the videophones for work, nor offer incentives for using the videophones or providing them to patients.

The aim of the system is to allow constant and unobtrusive monitoring of a patient in order to enhance autonomy and increase quality of life. Data collected by the sensor network are used to support a reasoning component, which is based on answer set programming (ASP), in performing three main reasoning tasks: (i) continuous contextualization of the physical, mental and social state of a patient, (ii) prediction of possibly risky situations and (iii) identification of plausible causes for the worsening of a patient's health. Starting from different data sources (sensor data, test results, inference results) the reasoning component applies expressive logic rules aimed at correct interpretation of incomplete or inconsistent contextual information, and evaluates correlation rules expressed by clinicians. The expressive power of ASP allows efficient enough reasoning to support prevention, while declarativity simplifies rule-specification and allows automatic encoding of knowledge. Preliminary evaluations show that the combination of an ASP-based reasoning component and a WSN is a good solution for creating a home-based healthcare system.},

Intercoder reliability can be used as a proxy for the validity of constructs that emerge from the data. Popular methods for establishing intercoder reliability involve presenting predetermined text segments to coders. Using this approach, researchers run the risk of altering meanings by lifting text from its original context, or making interpretations about the length of codable text. This article describes a set of procedures that was used to develop and assess intercoder reliability with free-flowing text data, in which the coders themselves determined the length of codable text segments. Content analysis of open-ended interview data collected from twenty third-generation Japanese American men and women generated an intercoder reliability of more than .80 for fifteen of the seventeen themes, an average agreement of .90 across all themes, and consistency among the coders in how they segmented coded text. The findings suggest that these procedures may be useful for validating the conclusions drawn from other qualitative studies using text data.},

The authors argue that the concept of “integrated patient care” would benefit from further clarification regarding (a) the object of integration and (b) its essential components, particularly when constructing measures.To address these issues, the authors propose a definition of integrated patient care that distinguishes it from integrated delivery organizations, acknowledging that integrated organizational structures and processes may fail to produce integrated patient care. The definition emphasizes patients’ central role as active participants in managing their own health by including patient centeredness as a key element of integrated patient care. Measures based on the proposed definition will enable empirical assessment of the potential relationships between the integration of organizations, the integration of patient care, and patient outcomes, providing valuable guidance to health systems reformers.},

	abstract = {Background
Few hospice and palliative care organizations use health information technology (HIT) for data collection and management; the feasibility and utility of a HIT-based approach in this multi-faceted, interdisciplinary context is unclear.
Purpose
To develop a HIT-based data infrastructure that serves multiple hospice and palliative care sites, meeting clinical and administrative needs with data, technical, and analytic support.
Methods
Through a multi-site academic/community partnership, a data infrastructure was collaboratively developed, pilot-tested at a community-based site, refined, and demonstrated for data collection and preliminary analysis. Additional sites, which participated in system development, became prepared to contribute data to the growing aggregate database.
Results
Electronic data collection proved feasible in community-based hospice and palliative care. The project highlighted “success factors” for implementing HIT in this field: engagement of site-based project “champions” to promote the system from within; involvement of stakeholders at all levels of the organization, to promote culture change and buy-in; attention to local needs (e.g., data for quality reporting) and requirements (e.g., affordable cost, efficiency); consideration of practical factors (e.g., potential to interfere with clinical flow); provision of adequate software, technical, analytic, and statistical support; availability of flexible HIT options (e.g., different data-collection platforms); and adoption of a consortium approach in which sites can support one another, learn from each others' experiences, pool data, and benefit from economies of scale.
Conclusions
In hospice and palliative care, HIT-based data collection/management has potential to generate better understanding of populations and outcomes, support quality assessment/quality improvement, and prepare sites to participate in research.},

	abstract = {Context
Electronic medical records (EMRs) are increasingly viewed as essential tools for quality assurance and improvement in many care settings, but little is known about the use of EMRs by hospices in their quality assessment and performance improvement (QAPI) programs.
Objectives
To examine the data sources hospices use to create quality indicators (QIs) used in their QAPI programs and to examine the domains of EMR-based QIs.
Methods
We used self-reported QIs (description, numerator, and denominator) from 911 hospices nationwide that participated in the Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services nationwide hospice voluntary reporting period. The data reflected QIs that hospices used for their internal QAPI programs between October 1 and December 31, 2011. We used the primary data sources for QIs reported by hospices and analyzed EMR-based QIs in terms of the quality domains and themes addressed.
Results
EMRs were the most frequent data source for the QIs reported, followed by family survey and paper medical record. Physical symptom management was the largest quality domain—included in 51.5\% of the reported EMR-based QIs—followed by patient safety and structure and process of care.
Conclusion
Most participating hospices use EMRs for retrieving items needed for QI calculations. EMR-based QIs address various quality domains and themes. Our findings present opportunities for potential future reporting of EMR-based quality data.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate effects on patient outcomes of Outcome-Based Quality Improvement (OBQI), a continuous quality improvement methodology for home health care (HHC). DESIGN: A quasi-experimental design with prospective pre/post and study/control components within two multiyear demonstration trials (occurring from 1995 to 2000) in which 73 home health agencies implemented OBQI, receiving several annual cycles of outcome reports to evaluate and enhance patient outcomes. SETTING: New York and 27 other states. PARTICIPANTS: The study involved 157,548 predominantly older adult patients admitted over 3 years to 54 OBQI agencies from 27 states in the National Demonstration Trial, 105,917 patients admitted over 4 years to 19 OBQI agencies in the New York State Trial, and 248,621 patients admitted over 3 years to non-OBQI control agencies in the 27 demonstration states. INTERVENTION: As a clinical management and administrative intervention, OBQI involves collecting, encoding, and transmitting patient-level health status data to a central source that provides each OBQI agency with a risk-adjusted outcome report comparing the agency's patient outcomes with those from a reference population and with its own outcomes from the prior period. Target outcomes are selected and focused plans of action implemented to change care behaviors. Outcome changes are evaluated through the next report cycle. MEASUREMENTS: Outcome measures include hospitalization rates and improvement and stabilization outcome rates in functional, physiological, emotional/behavioral, and cognitive health. RESULTS: For the National and New York State Demonstration Trials, the risk-adjusted relative rates of decline in hospitalization of 22\% and 26\%, respectively, for OBQI patients over the 3-year and 4-year demonstration periods were significant (P {\textless} .001) and unparalleled by considerably smaller rates of decline for the non-OBQI patients in the 27 states. The risk-adjusted rates of improvement in OBQI target outcome measures of health status averaged 5\% to 7\% per year in both demonstration trials and were significantly greater (P {\textless} .05) than analogous improvement rates for nontarget comparison outcomes, which averaged about 1\% per year. CONCLUSION: It is feasible to integrate the programmatic, data collection, data transmission, and outcome enhancement components of OBQI into the day-to-day operations of home health agencies. The aggregate findings and the agency-level evidence available from site-specific communications suggest that OBQI had a pervasive effect on outcome improvement for home health patients. OBQI appears to warrant expansion and refinement in HHC and experimentation in other healthcare settings.},

	abstract = {Issues. Countries and international organizations have recently renewed their interest in how health systems perform. This has led to the development of performance indicators for monitoring, assessing, and managing health systems to achieve effectiveness, equity, efficiency, and quality. Although the indicators populate conceptual frameworks, it is often not very clear just what the underlying concepts might be or how effectiveness is conceptualized and measured. Furthermore, there is a gap in the knowledge of how the resultant performance data are used to stimulate improvement and to ensure health care quality.
Addressing the issues. This paper therefore explores, individually, the conceptual bases, effectiveness and its indicators, as well as the quality improvement dynamics of the performance frameworks of the UK, Canada, Australia, US, World Health Organization, and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
Results. We see that they all conceive health and health system performance in one or more supportive frameworks, but differ in concepts and operations. Effectiveness often implies, nationally, the achievement of high quality outcomes of care, or internationally, the efficient achievement of system objectives, or both. Its indicators are therefore mainly outcome and, less so, process measures. The frameworks are linked to a combination of tools and initiatives to stimulate and manage performance and quality improvement.
Conclusions. These dynamics may ensure the proper environment for these conceptual frameworks where, alongside objectives such as equity and efficiency, effectiveness (therefore, quality) becomes the core of health systems performance.},

Design: Randomised controlled trial with one year's follow up.
Setting: Community health service at a New Zealand hospital.
Participants: 240 women and men aged 75 years and older.
Intervention: 121 participants received the exercise programme (exercise group) and 119 received usual care (control group); 90\% (211 of 233) completed the trial.
Main outcome measures: Number of falls, number of injuries resulting from falls, costs of implementing the programme, and hospital costs as a result of falls.
Results: Falls were reduced by 46\% (incidence rate ratio 0.54, 95\% confidence interval 0.32 to 0.90). Five hospital admissions were due to injuries caused by falls in the control group and none in the exercise group. The programme cost \$NZ1803 (£523) (at 1998 prices) per fall prevented for delivering the programme and \$NZ155 per fall prevented when hospital costs averted were considered.
Conclusion: A home exercise programme, previously shown to be successful when delivered by a physiotherapist, was also effective in reducing falls when delivered by a trained nurse from within a home health service. Serious injuries and hospital admissions due to falls were also reduced. The programme was cost effective in participants aged 80 years and older compared with younger participants.},

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Failure-to-attend (FTA) rate compared between the trial group, whose members were sent a reminder, and the historical control group, whose members were not sent a reminder. Financial benefits versus cost of sending reminders.
RESULTS: 22,658 patients with a mobile telephone contact number scheduled to attend an outpatient clinic appointment in October, November and December 2004 were sent an SMS reminder; 20,448 (90.2\%) of these patients attended their appointment. The control group included 22,452 patients with a mobile telephone contact number scheduled to attend an appointment, with 18,073 (80.5\%) patients attending. The FTA rate was significantly lower in the trial group than in the historical control group (9.8\% v 19.5\%; P {\textless} 0.001). The cost of sending the SMS reminders was small compared with the increase in patient revenue and associated benefits generated as a result of improved attendance.
CONCLUSIONS: The observed reduction in FTA rate was in line with that found using traditional reminder methods and a prior pilot study using SMS. The FTA reduction coupled with the increase in patient revenue suggests that reminding patients using SMS is a very cost effective approach for improving patient attendance.},

	abstract = {AIMS: To assess Sweet Talk, a text-messaging support system designed to enhance self-efficacy, facilitate uptake of intensive insulin therapy and improve glycaemic control in paediatric patients with Type 1 diabetes.
METHODS: One hundred and twenty-six patients fulfilled the eligibility criteria; Type 1 diabetes for {\textgreater} 1 year, on conventional insulin therapy, aged 8-18 years. Ninety-two patients were randomized to conventional insulin therapy (n = 28), conventional therapy and Sweet Talk (n = 33) or intensive insulin therapy and Sweet Talk (n = 31). Goal-setting at clinic visits was reinforced by daily text-messages from the Sweet Talk software system, containing personalized goal-specific prompts and messages tailored to patients' age, sex and insulin regimen.
RESULTS: HbA(1c) did not change in patients on conventional therapy without or with Sweet Talk (10.3 +/- 1.7 vs. 10.1 +/- 1.7\%), but improved in patients randomized to intensive therapy and Sweet Talk (9.2 +/- 2.2\%, 95\% CI -1.9, -0.5, P {\textless} 0.001). Sweet Talk was associated with improvement in diabetes self-efficacy (conventional therapy 56.0 +/- 13.7, conventional therapy plus Sweet Talk 62.1 +/- 6.6, 95\% CI +2.6, +7.5, P = 0.003) and self-reported adherence (conventional therapy 70.4 +/- 20.0, conventional therapy plus Sweet Talk 77.2 +/- 16.1, 95\% CI +0.4, +17.4, P = 0.042). When surveyed, 82\% of patients felt that Sweet Talk had improved their diabetes self-management and 90\% wanted to continue receiving messages.
CONCLUSIONS: Sweet Talk was associated with improved self-efficacy and adherence; engaging a classically difficult to reach group of young people. While Sweet Talk alone did not improve glycaemic control, it may have had a role in supporting the introduction of intensive insulin therapy. Scheduled, tailored text messaging offers an innovative means of supporting adolescents with diabetes and could be adapted for other health-care settings and chronic diseases.},

	abstract = {Objective To examine the financial impact health information exchange (HIE) in emergency departments (EDs).
Materials and Methods We studied all ED encounters over a 13-month period in which HIE data were accessed in all major emergency departments Memphis, Tennessee. HIE access encounter records were matched with similar encounter records without HIE access. Outcomes studied were ED-originated hospital admissions, admissions for observation, laboratory testing, head CT, body CT, ankle radiographs, chest radiographs, and echocardiograms. Our estimates employed generalized estimating equations for logistic regression models adjusted for admission type, length of stay, and Charlson co-morbidity index. Marginal probabilities were used to calculate changes in outcome variables and their financial consequences.
Results HIE data were accessed in approximately 6.8\% of ED visits across 12 EDs studied. In 11 EDs directly accessing HIE data only through a secure Web browser, access was associated with a decrease in hospital admissions (adjusted odds ratio (OR)=0.27; p{\textless}0001). In a 12th ED relying more on print summaries, HIE access was associated with a decrease in hospital admissions (OR=0.48; p{\textless}0001) and statistically significant decreases in head CT use, body CT use, and laboratory test ordering.
Discussion Applied only to the study population, HIE access was associated with an annual cost savings of \$1.9 million. Net of annual operating costs, HIE access reduced overall costs by \$1.07 million. Hospital admission reductions accounted for 97.6\% of total cost reductions.
Conclusion Access to additional clinical data through HIE in emergency department settings is associated with net societal saving.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dramatic advances in health information technologies necessitate a comprehensive evaluation framework covering all phases of development, from conception to routine operational use.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this article was to illustrate the application of an informatics evaluation framework that provides a heuristic for matching the stage of system design and the level of evaluation.
METHODS: An evaluation framework is illustrated in the context of five studies in different stages of system design.
RESULTS: The studies discussed in this article represent the various stages of the framework. In addition, they are examples of how evaluation research studies not only contribute to the assessment of system design but also constitute distinct contributions to knowledge.
DISCUSSION: The ability to engineer advanced information systems has exceeded the understanding of how to deploy them effectively in complex settings and to adapt them to a range of user populations. A systematic, continuous evaluation increases the likelihood that the conditions for success will be understood, including how to tailor a system, how to maintain the target population's use of the system, and how to innovate continually to enhance the functionality of the system and the users' experience. Without sound evaluation methodologies throughout the stages of system development, information systems have limited potential to influence healthcare processes positively.},

Questionnaire, interview and observation data from 46 nurses in medical-surgical and intensive care units at two community hospitals within a regional healthcare system (second year of EHR implementation) were analyzed for themes and compared across hospital and unit dimensions. Nurses preferred EHRs to paper charts and were comfortable with technology. They felt EHR use enhanced nursing work through increased information access, improved organization and efficiency, and alert screens. They felt it hindered nursing work through increased documentation time (slow system response, multiple screens), decreased interdisciplinary communication and impaired critical thinking through overuse of checkboxes and "copy and paste" documentation. 73\% spent at least half their work time using EHRs, and felt use enabled them to provide safer care but decreased quality of care. Administrative implications include streamlining EHR work processes, developing guidelines to improve consistency in documentation quality and location, increasing system speed, and choosing hardware that encourages bedside use.},

To identify potential accidents in the making, the authors looked for side effects from a natural experiment, the implementation of bar code medication administration (BCMA), a technology designed to reduce adverse drug events (ADEs).
Design Cross-sectional observational study of medication passes before (21 hours of observation of 7 nurses at 1 hospital) and after (60 hours of observation of 26 nurses at 3 hospitals) BCMA implementation.
Measurements Detailed, handwritten field notes of targeted ethnographic observations of in situ nurse–BCMA interactions were iteratively analyzed using process tracing and five conceptual frameworks.
Results Ethnographic observations distilled into 67 nurse–BCMA interactions were classified into 12 categories. We identified five negative side effects after BCMA implementation: (1) nurses confused by automated removal of medications by BCMA, (2) degraded coordination between nurses and physicians, (3) nurses dropping activities to reduce workload during busy periods, (4) increased prioritization of monitored activities during goal conflicts, and (5) decreased ability to deviate from routine sequences.
Conclusion These side effects might create new paths to ADEs. We recommend design revisions, modification of organizational policies, and “best practices” training that could potentially minimize or eliminate these side effects before they contribute to adverse outcomes.},

Measurements Perceptions of the potential effects of HIE on healthcare costs, quality of care, clinicians' time, patients' privacy concerns, and willingness to pay for HIE.
Results After excluding 253 physicians who did not see any outpatients, we analyzed 1043 responses. Overall, 70\% indicated that HIE would reduce costs, while 86\% said it would improve quality and 76\% believed that it would save time. On the other hand, 16\% reported being very concerned about HIE's effect on privacy, while 55.0\% were somewhat concerned and 29\% not at all concerned. Slightly more than half of the physicians (54\%) said they would be willing to pay an unspecified monthly fee to participate in HIE, but only 37\% said they would be willing to pay \$150 per month for it. Primary care physicians and those in larger practices tended to have more positive attitudes toward HIE.
Conclusions Physicians perceive that HIE will have generally positive effects, though a considerable fraction harbor concerns about privacy. While physicians may be willing to participate in HIE, they are not consistently willing to pay to participate.

The purpose of this paper is to review and categorize health IT usability study methods and to provide practical guidance on health IT usability evaluation. 2025 references were initially retrieved from the Medline database from 2003 to 2009 that evaluated health IT used by clinicians. Titles and abstracts were first reviewed for inclusion. Full-text articles were then examined to identify final eligibility studies. 629 studies were categorized into the five stages of an integrated usability specification and evaluation framework that was based on a usability model and the system development life cycle (SDLC)-associated stages of evaluation. Theoretical and methodological aspects of 319 studies were extracted in greater detail and studies that focused on system validation (SDLC stage 2) were not assessed further. The number of studies by stage was: stage 1, task-based or user–task interaction, n=42; stage 2, system–task interaction, n=310; stage 3, user–task–system interaction, n=69; stage 4, user–task–system–environment interaction, n=54; and stage 5, user–task–system–environment interaction in routine use, n=199. The studies applied a variety of quantitative and qualitative approaches. Methodological issues included lack of theoretical framework/model, lack of details regarding qualitative study approaches, single evaluation focus, environmental factors not evaluated in the early stages, and guideline adherence as the primary outcome for decision support system evaluations. Based on the findings, a three-level stratified view of health IT usability evaluation is proposed and methodological guidance is offered based upon the type of interaction that is of primary interest in the evaluation.},

While the survey of physicians was cross-sectional, respondents indicated the year in which they adopted EHR. In an analysis accounting for duration of EHR use, we examined the relationship between EHR adoption and quality of care.
Results The percent of physicians reporting adoption of EHR and availability of EHR core functions more than doubled between 2000 and 2005. Among EHR users in 2005, the average duration of EHR use was 4.8 years. For all 6 clinical conditions, there was no difference in performance between EHR users and non-users. In addition, for these 6 clinical conditions, there was no consistent pattern between length of time using an EHR and physicians performance on quality measures in both bivariate and multivariate analyses.
Conclusions In this cross-sectional study, we found no association between duration of using an EHR and performance with respect to quality of care, although power was limited. Intensifying the use of key EHR features, such as clinical decision support, may be needed to realize quality improvement from EHRs. Future studies should examine the relationship between the extent to which physicians use key EHR functions and their performance on quality measures over time.},

We used recent data from the American Hospital Association Annual Survey of Hospitals—IT Supplement to assess progress and challenges. EHR adoption among US hospitals continues to rise steeply: 59 percent now have at least a basic EHR. Small and rural hospitals continue to lag behind their better resourced counterparts. Most hospitals are able to meet many of the stage 2 meaningful-use criteria, but only 5.8 percent of hospitals are able meet them all. Several criteria, including sharing care summaries with other providers and providing patients with online access to their data, will require attention from EHR vendors to ensure that the necessary functions are available and additional effort from many hospitals to make certain that these functionalities are used. Policy makers may want to consider new targeted strategies to ensure that all hospitals move toward meaningful use of EHRs.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Over 200,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur in the United States each year and many of these events may be preventable. Current vital sign-based risk scores for ward patients have demonstrated limited accuracy, which leads to missed opportunities to identify those patients most likely to suffer cardiac arrest and inefficient resource utilization. We derived and validated a prediction model for cardiac arrest while treating ICU transfer as a competing risk using electronic health record data.
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: An academic medical center in the United States with approximately 500 inpatient beds.
PATIENTS: Adult patients hospitalized from November 2008 until August 2011 who had documented ward vital signs.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Vital sign, demographic, location, and laboratory data were extracted from the electronic health record and investigated as potential predictor variables. A person-time multinomial logistic regression model was used to simultaneously predict cardiac arrest and ICU transfer. The prediction model was compared to the VitalPAC Early Warning Score using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and was validated using three-fold cross-validation. A total of 56,649 controls, 109 cardiac arrest patients, and 2,543 ICU transfers were included. The derived model more accurately detected cardiac arrest (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.88 vs 0.78; p {\textless} 0.001) and ICU transfer (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.77 vs 0.73; p {\textless} 0.001) than the VitalPAC Early Warning Score, and accuracy was similar with cross-validation. At a specificity of 93\%, our model had a higher sensitivity than the VitalPAC Early Warning Score for cardiac arrest patients (65\% vs 41\%).
CONCLUSIONS: We developed and validated a prediction tool for ward patients that can simultaneously predict the risk of cardiac arrest and ICU transfer. Our model was more accurate than the VitalPAC Early Warning Score and could be implemented in the electronic health record to alert caregivers with real-time information regarding patient deterioration.},

Design Nationally representative, cross-sectional survey of US HHH agencies conducted in 2007.
Measurements Data on agency characteristics, current use of EMR systems as well as use of telemedicine and PoCD were collected.
Results In 2007, 43\% of US HHH agencies reported use of an EMR system. Patient demographics (40\%) and clinical notes (34\%) were the most commonly used EMR functions among US HHH agencies. Only 20\% of agencies with EMR systems had health information sharing functionality and about half of them used it. Telemedicine was used by 21\% of all HHH agencies, with most (87\%) of these offering home health services. Among home health agencies using telemedicine, greater than 90\% used telephone monitoring and about two-thirds used non-video monitoring. Nearly 29\% of HHH agencies reported using electronic PoCD systems, most often for Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) data capture (79\%). Relative to for-profit HHH agencies, non-profit agencies used considerably more EMR (70\% vs 28\%, p{\textless}0.001) and PoCD (63\% vs 9\%, p{\textless}0.001).
Conclusions Between 2000 and 2007, there was a 33\% increase in use of EMR among HHH agencies in the US. In 2007, use of EMR and PoCD technologies in non-profit agencies was significantly higher than for-profit ones. Finally, HHH agencies generally tended to use available EMR functionalities, including health information sharing.},

	abstract = {Background: In the context of limited resources, evidence on costs and cost-effectiveness of alternative methods of delivering health-care services is increasingly important to facilitate appropriate resource allocation. Palliative care services have been expanding worldwide with the aim of improving the experience of patients with terminal illness at the end of life through better symptom control, coordination of care and improved communication between professionals and the patient and family.
Aim: To present results from a comprehensive literature review of available international evidence on the costs and cost-effectiveness of palliative care interventions in any setting (e.g. hospital-based, home-based and hospice care) over the period 2002–2011.
Design: Key bibliographic and review databases were searched. Quality of retrieved papers was assessed against a set of 31 indicators developed for this review.
Data Sources: PubMed, EURONHEED, the Applied Social Sciences Index and the Cochrane library of databases.
Results: A total of 46 papers met the criteria for inclusion in the review, examining the cost and/or utilisation implications of a palliative care intervention with some form of comparator. The main focus of these studies was on direct costs with little focus on informal care or out-of-pocket costs. The overall quality of the studies is mixed, although a number of cohort studies do undertake multivariate regression analysis.
Conclusion: Despite wide variation in study type, characteristic and study quality, there are consistent patterns in the results. Palliative care is most frequently found to be less costly relative to comparator groups, and in most cases, the difference in cost is statistically significant.},

	abstract = {Background 
We examined deaths of Medicare beneficiaries in Massachusetts and California to evaluate the effect of managed care on the use of hospice and site of death and to determine how hospice affects the expenditures for the last year of life.Methods
Medicare data for beneficiaries in Massachusetts (n = 37 933) and California (n = 27 685) who died in 1996 were merged with each state's death certificate files to determine site and cause of death. Expenditure data were Health Care Financing Administration payments and were divided into 30-day periods from the date of death back 12 months.Results
In Massachusetts, only 7\% of decedents were enrolled in managed care organizations (MCOs); in California, 28\%. More than 60\% of hospice users had cancer. Hospice use was much lower in Massachusetts than in California (12\% vs 18\%). In both states, decedents enrolled in MCOs used hospice care much more than those enrolled in fee-for-service plans (17\% vs 11\% in Massachusetts and 25\% vs 15\% in California). This pattern persisted for those with cancer and younger (aged 65-74 years) decedents. Decedents receiving hospice care were significantly (P{\textless}.001 for both) less likely to die in the hospital (11\% vs 43\% in Massachusetts and 5\% vs 43\% in California). Enrollment in MCOs did not affect the proportion of in-hospital deaths (those enrolled in fee-for-service plans vs MCOs: 40\% vs 39\% in Massachusetts; and 37\% vs 34\% in California). Expenditures in the last year of life were \$28 588 in Massachusetts and \$27 814 in California; about one third of the expenditures occurred in the last month before death. Hospital services accounted for more than 50\% of all expenditures in both states, despite 77\% of decedents being hospitalized in Massachusetts and just 55\% being hospitalized in California. Among patients with cancer, expenditures were 13\% to 20\% lower for those in hospice.Conclusions
Medicare-insured decedents in California were more than 4 times more likely to be enrolled in MCOs, were 50\% more likely to use a hospice, and had a 30\% lower hospitalization rate than decedents in Massachusetts, yet there are few differences in out-of-hospital deaths or expenditures in the last year of life. However, patients with cancer using hospice did have significant savings.},

Examining quality indicators, utilization, and costs for 1996–2002 for adults with four conditions, we find evidence of substantial quality improvement but not cost savings. The causal pathway—from improved care to reduced morbidity to cost savings—has not produced sufficient savings to offset the rising costs of improved care. We conclude that the rationale for DM programs, like the rationale for any medical treatments, should rest on their effectiveness and value.},

	abstract = {Context Medicare expenditures of patients with chronic illnesses might be reduced through improvements in care, patient adherence, and communication.Objective To determine whether care coordination programs reduced hospitalizations and Medicare expenditures and improved quality of care for chronically ill Medicare beneficiaries.Design, Setting, and Patients Eligible fee-for-service Medicare patients (primarily with congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, and diabetes) who volunteered to participate between April 2002 and June 2005 in 15 care coordination programs (each received a negotiated monthly fee per patient from Medicare) were randomly assigned to treatment or control (usual care) status. Hospitalizations, costs, and some quality-of-care outcomes were measured with claims data for 18 309 patients (n = 178 to 2657 per program) from patients' enrollment through June 2006. A patient survey 7 to 12 months after enrollment provided additional quality-of-care measures.Interventions Nurses provided patient education and monitoring (mostly via telephone) to improve adherence and ability to communicate with physicians. Patients were contacted twice per month on average; frequency varied widely.Main Outcome Measures Hospitalizations, monthly Medicare expenditures, patient-reported and care process indicators.Results Thirteen of the 15 programs showed no significant (P{\textless}.05) differences in hospitalizations; however, Mercy had 0.168 fewer hospitalizations per person per year (90\% confidence interval [CI], −0.283 to −0.054; 17\% less than the control group mean, P=.02) and Charlestown had 0.118 more hospitalizations per person per year (90\% CI, 0.025-0.210; 19\% more than the control group mean, P=.04). None of the 15 programs generated net savings. Treatment group members in 3 programs (Health Quality Partners [HQP], Georgetown, Mercy) had monthly Medicare expenditures less than the control group by 9\% to 14\% (−\$84; 90\% CI, −\$171 to \$4; P=.12; −\$358; 90\% CI, −\$934 to \$218; P=.31; and −\$112; 90\% CI, −\$231 to \$8; P=.12; respectively). Savings offset fees for HQP and Georgetown but not for Mercy; Georgetown was too small to be sustainable. These programs had favorable effects on none of the adherence measures and only a few of many quality of care indicators examined.Conclusions Viable care coordination programs without a strong transitional care component are unlikely to yield net Medicare savings. Programs with substantial in-person contact that target moderate to severe patients can be cost-neutral and improve some aspects of care.Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00627029},

Differences in outcome may be due to case mix, how the data were collected, chance, or quality of care. Health care is only one determinant of health and other factors have important effects on health outcomes, such as nutrition, environment, lifestyle and poverty. The advantages of process measures are that they are more sensitive to differences in the quality of care and they are direct measures of quality. However, outcome measures are of greater intrinsic interest and can reflect all aspects of care, including those that are otherwise difficult to measure such as technical expertise and operator skill. Outcome indicators can be improved if efforts are made to standardize data collection and case mix adjustment systems are developed and validated. It is argued that this is worth doing only where it is likely that variations in health care might lead to significant variations in health outcome and where the occurrence of the outcome is sufficiently common that the outcome indicator will have the power to detect real differences in quality. If these conditions are not met, then alternative strategies such as process measurement and risk management techniques may be more effective at protecting the public from poor quality care.},

Furthermore, randomized prospective trials have shown that 12\% to 75\% of all readmissions can be prevented by patient education, predischarge assessment, and domiciliary aftercare. We conclude that most readmissions seem to be caused by unmodifiable causes, and that, pending an agreed-on method to adjust for confounders, global readmission rates are not a useful indicator of quality of care. However, high readmission rates of patients with defined conditions, such as diabetes and bronchial asthma, may identify quality-of-care problems.

However, the existence of home hazards alone is insufficient to cause falls, and the interaction between an older person’s physical abilities and their exposure to environmental stressors appears to be more important. Taking risks or impulsivity may further elevate falls risk. Some studies have found that environmental hazards contribute to falls to a greater extent in older vigorous people than in older frail people. This appears to be due to increased exposure to falls hazards with an increase in the proportion of such falls occurring outside the home. There may also be a non-linear pattern between mobility and falls associated with hazards. Household environmental hazards may pose the greatest risk for older people with fair balance, whereas those with poor balance are less exposed to hazards and those with good mobility are more able to withstand them. Reducing hazards in the home appears not to be an effective falls-prevention strategy in the general older population and those at low risk of falls. Home hazard reduction is effective if targeted at older people with a history of falls and mobility limitations. The effectiveness may depend on the provision of concomitant training for improving transfer abilities and other strategies for effecting behaviour change.},

	abstract = {Home health care clinicians seek to provide high quality, safe care in ways that honor patient autonomy and accommodate the individual characteristics of each patient’s home and family. Falls, declining functional abilities, pressure ulcers and nonhealing wounds, and adverse events related to medication administration all have the potential to result in unplanned hospital admissions. Such hospitalizations undermine the achievement of important home health care goals: keeping patients at home and promoting optimal well-being. Nevertheless, the unique characteristics of home health care may make it difficult to use—or necessary to alter—interventions that have been shown to be effective in other settings. Therefore, research on effective practices, conducted in home health care settings, is necessary to support excellent and evidence-based care. In reviewing the extant studies, the authors of this chapter found useful evidence in all selected areas. However, the number of studies was few and many questions remain. Replications of investigations originally conducted in health care settings other than the home, and studies considering home health care-specific issues are needed to support evidence-based clinical decisions. The available evidence suggests that the work environment in which home health care nurses practice may indirectly influence patient outcomes in many areas, and that technology can be used to support positive patient outcomes. Thus, studies that link nurse-related variables to improved care safety and quality are needed, as well as studies that focus directly on patients. The demographics of an aging society will sustain the trend toward home-based care. Home health care practices grounded in careful research will sustain the patients and the clinicians who serve them.

	abstract = {Home Care (HC) assistance is emerging as an effective and efficient alternative to institutionalized care, especially for the case of senior patients that present multiple co-morbidities and require life long treatments under continuous supervision. The care of such patients requires the definition of specially tailored treatments and their delivery involves the coordination of a team of professionals from different institutions, requiring the management of many kinds of knowledge (medical, organizational, social and procedural). The K4Care project aims to assist the HC of elderly patients by proposing a standard HC model and implementing it in a knowledge-driven e-health platform aimed to support the provision of HC services. This paper focuses on two knowledge-based personalization aspects incorporated in the platform that aim to overcome the difficulties of HC delivery. The first one is the assistance to medical practitioners in the process of defining a customized treatment adjusted to the medical and social conditions of a particular patient in order to consider multiple co-morbidities. The second one is the possibility of tailoring the profiles of the care professionals according to the medical and organizational daily requirements in order to allow a flexible care delivery. Those two aspects, guided by the knowledge explicitly represented in the platform, play a crucial role in the medical and social acceptance of this kind of e-health systems. The paper also includes a real case study designed and tested by healthcare professionals and includes encouraging results from the test of the platform in a real health care environment in the city of Pollenza (Italy).},

Congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and chronic wound-care patients receiving skilled home nursing care were randomized into control (standard home health care, HHC) and two intervention (standard care plus video conferencing/Internet access; the above plus physiological monitoring) groups. Virtual visits (VVs), consisting of two-way audio and video interactions between the central site HHC nurse and the subject at home, were compared for technical quality and clinical usefulness by the HHC nurses who performed the VVs. Subject perception of telehomecare and satisfaction with their HHC were assessed over the course of the project. There were a total of 567 virtual and 1,057 actual visits conducted for the 53 subjects completing the study. The technical quality of VVs were rated at 94.7\%. They were considered to be as useful as actual visits in 90.7\% of cases. Subject telehomecare perception increased after experiencing the process. All subjects were satisfied with their HHC; satisfaction increased with an increasing level of telehomecare intervention. Subjects receiving physiological monitoring and video conferencing/Internet access in addition to standard care were most satisfied with their care. VVs can be conducted over POTS. Patients can use telehomecare with moderate levels of training. These programs can provide timely and quality home health nursing care with VVs augmenting traditional home visits.},

We assessed the effect of an automated smoking cessation programme delivered via mobile phone text messaging on continuous abstinence, which was biochemically verified at 6 months.
METHODS: In this single-blind, randomised trial, undertaken in the UK, smokers willing to make a quit attempt were randomly allocated, using an independent telephone randomisation system, to a mobile phone text messaging smoking cessation programme (txt2stop), comprising motivational messages and behavioural-change support, or to a control group that received text messages unrelated to quitting. The system automatically generated intervention or control group texts according to the allocation. Outcome assessors were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was self-reported continuous smoking abstinence, biochemically verified at 6 months. All analyses were by intention to treat. This study is registered, number ISRCTN 80978588.
FINDINGS: We assessed 11,914 participants for eligibility. 5800 participants were randomised, of whom 2915 smokers were allocated to the txt2stop intervention and 2885 were allocated to the control group; eight were excluded because they were randomised more than once. Primary outcome data were available for 5524 (95\%) participants. Biochemically verified continuous abstinence at 6 months was significantly increased in the txt2stop group (10·7\% txt2stop vs 4·9\% control, relative risk [RR] 2·20, 95\% CI 1·80-2·68; p{\textless}0·0001). Similar results were obtained when participants that were lost to follow-up were treated as smokers (268 [9\%] of 2911 txt2stop vs 124 [4\%] of 2881 control [RR 2·14, 95\% CI 1·74-2·63; p{\textless}0·0001]), and when they were excluded (268 [10\%] of 2735 txt2stop vs 124 [4\%] of 2789 control [2·20, 1·79-2·71; p{\textless}0·0001]). No significant heterogeneity was shown in any of the prespecified subgroups.
INTERPRETATION: The txt2stop smoking cessation programme significantly improved smoking cessation rates at 6 months and should be considered for inclusion in smoking cessation services.

Health information exchange makes this possible.

Here we present an overview of six different ways in which HIE can improve patient safety—improved medication information processing, improved laboratory information processing, improved radiology information processing, improved communication among providers, improved communication between patients and providers, and improved public health information processing. Within the area of improved medication information processing we discuss drug-allergy information processing, drug–dose information processing, drug–drug information processing, drug-diagnosis information processing, and drug–gene information processing. We also briefly discuss HIE and decreased patient safety as well as standards and completeness of information for HIE and patient safety.},

The expanded Medicaid and private insurance coverage are expected to increase demand for health care significantly, particularly for prescription drugs and physician and clinical services. Robust growth in Medicare enrollment, expanded Medicaid coverage, and premium and cost-sharing subsidies for exchange plans are projected to increase the federal government share of health spending from 27 percent in 2009 to 31 percent by 2020.

	abstract = {Delays in diagnosis and treatment are widely considered to be threats to outpatient safety. However, few studies have identified and described what factors contribute to delays that might result in patient harm in the outpatient setting. We analyzed 111 root cause analysis reports that investigated such delays and were submitted to the Veterans Affairs National Center for Patient Safety in the period 2005–12. The most common contributing factors noted in the reports included coordination problems resulting from inadequate follow-up planning, delayed scheduling for unspecified reasons, inadequate tracking of test results, and the absence of a system to track patients in need of short-term follow-up. Other contributing factors were team-level decision-making problems resulting from miscommunication of urgency between providers and providers’ lack of awareness of or knowledge about a patient’s situation; and communication failures among providers, patients, and other health care team members. Our findings suggest that to support care goals in the Affordable Care Act and the National Quality Strategy, even relatively sophisticated electronic health record systems will require enhancements. At the same time, policy initiatives should support programs to implement, and perhaps reward the use of, more rigorous interprofessional teamwork principles to improve outpatient communication and coordination.},

Notably, for-profit agencies scored lower than nonprofits on the clinically important outcome “avoidance of hospitalization” (71.64 percent versus 73.53 percent). Scores on quality measures were lowest in the South, where for-profits predominate. Compared to nonprofits, proprietary agencies also had higher costs per patient (\$4,827 versus \$4,075), were more profitable, and had higher administrative costs.

Data was collected through field observations (n = 12) and semi-structured individual interviews (n = 18) of CIS stakeholders in a Hong Kong nursing home, and analyzed using the immersion/crystallization approach. Complex interactions relevant to our case were contextualized and interpreted within the perspective of the Sittig-Singh Healthcare Socio-Technical Framework (HSTF). Three broad clusters of implementation barriers from the eight HSTF dimensions were identified: (a) Infrastructure-based barriers, which relate to conflict between government regulations and system functional needs of users; lack of financial support; inconsistency between workflow, work policy, and procedures; and inadequacy of hardware-software infrastructural and technical support; (b) Process-based barriers, which relate to mismatch between the technology, existing work practice and workflow, and communication; low system speed, accessibility, and stability; deficient computer literacy; more experience in health care profession; clinical content inadequacy and unavailability; as well as poor system usefulness and user interface design; and (c) Outcome-based barriers, which relate to the lack of measurement and monitoring of system effectiveness. Two additional dimensions underlining the importance of the ability of a CIS to change are proposed to extend the Sittig-Singh HSTF. First, advocacy would promote the articulation and influence of changes in the system and subsequent outcomes by CIS stakeholders, and second, adaptability would ensure the ability of the system to adjust to emerging needs. The broad set of discovered implementation shortcomings expands prior research on why CIS can fail in nursing home settings. Moreover, our investigation offers a knowledge base and recommendations that can serve as a guide for future implementation strategies and policies in CIS initiatives.},

	abstract = {The organization and processes of today's health and social care are becoming ever more complex as a consequence of societal trends, including an aging population and an increased reliance on care at home. One aspect of the increased complexity is that a single patient may receive care from several care providers, which easily results in situations with potentially incoherent, uncoordinated, and interfering care processes. In order to describe and analyze such situations, the article introduces the notion of a process conglomeration. This is defined as a set of patient-care processes that all concern the same patient, that are overlapping in time, and that all are sharing the overall goal of improving or maintaining the health and social well-being of the patient. Problems and challenges of process conglomerations are investigated using coordination theory and models for continuous process improvement. In order to address the challenges, a solution is proposed in the form of a Coordination Hub, being an integrated software service that offers a number of information services for coordinating the activities of the processes in a process conglomeration.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Veterans Health Administration (VHA) seeks to improve the delivery of patient-centered care. A Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) Model, named Patient Aligned Care Team (PACT), was implemented to transform the VHA primary care delivery process. VHA used a collaborative learning model as a key approach to disseminate PACT concepts and changes. OBJECTIVE To describe and examine VHA’s experience disseminating PACT transformation using a Breakthrough Series Collaborative method. DESIGN Observational study. PARTICIPANTS Approximately 250–350 individuals from 141 teams participated in six face-to-face learning sessions across 21 months. MAIN MEASURES 1) PACT Collaborative participant surveys; 2) Coach Assessment Scores and Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) data; and 3) PACT Compass (national measures to assess PACT implementation within VA healthcare system). KEY RESULTS A majority of the participants indicated that the PACT Collaborative was necessary to implement PACT. The number of PDSAs increased steadily during the Collaborative period; 93 \% (n = 1,547) of PDSAs were successfully implemented. Teams successfully achieved over 80 \% of their aims, which were highly correlated with PDSAs implemented (R2 = 0.88). The most successful aims achieved were offering same-day appointments, increasing non-face-to-face care, and improving team communication. PACT Compass indicated an improvement after the Collaborative (p-value {\textless} .000), and providers observed differences in their care practice (p-value {\textless} 0.002). This positive impact may be due to the spread of the PACT Model through the PACT Collaborative, among other learning initiatives. CONCLUSIONS For complex collaborative models such as PACT, more than three learning sessions may be required. As VHA continues to disseminate the PACT Model through primary care, into specialty/surgical care and beyond, the Collaborative Learning Model may continue to be an effective way to leverage a small number of faculty, coaches, and industrial engineers across an extremely large population.},

	issn = {1528-1132},
	doi = {10.1007/s11999-014-3851-z},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Payers of health services and policymakers place a major focus on cost containment in health care. Studies have shown that early planning of discharge is essential in reducing length of stay and achieving financial benefit; tools that can help predict discharge disposition would therefore be of use. The Risk Assessment and Prediction Tool (RAPT) is a preoperative survey constructed to predict discharge disposition after total joint arthroplasty (TJA). The RAPT was developed and tested on a population of Australian patients undergoing joint replacement, but its validity in other populations is unknown. A low RAPT score is reported to indicate a high risk of needing any form of inpatient rehabilitation after TJA, including short-term nursing facilities.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: This study attempts (1) to assess predictive accuracy of the RAPT on US patients undergoing total hip and knee arthroplasty (THA/TKA); and (2) to determine predictive accuracy of each individual score (1-12).
METHODS: Between June 2006 and December 2011, RAPT scores of 3213 patients (1449 THAs; 1764 TKAs) were prospectively captured during the preoperative clinical visit. Scores were stored along with other clinical data, including discharge disposition, in a dedicated database on a secure server. The database was queried by the nursing case manager to retrieve the RAPT scores of all patients captured during this time period. Binary logistic regression was used to analyze the scores and determine predictive accuracy.
RESULTS: Overall predictive accuracy was 78\%. RAPT scores {\textless} 6 and {\textgreater} 10 (of 12) predicted with {\textgreater} 90\% accuracy discharge to inpatient rehabilitation and home, respectively. Predictive accuracy was lowest for scores between 7 and 10 at 65.2\% and almost 50\% of patients received scores in this range. Based on our findings, the risk categories in our populations should be high risk {\textless} 7, intermediate risk 7 to 10, and low risk {\textgreater} 10.
CONCLUSIONS: The RAPT accurately predicted discharge disposition for high- and low-risk patients in our cohort. Based on our data, intermediate-risk patients should be defined as those with scores of 7 to 10. Predictive accuracy for these patients could potentially be improved through the identification and addition of other factors correlated to discharge disposition. The RAPT allows for identification of patients who are likely to be discharged home or to rehabilitation, which may facilitate preoperative planning of postoperative care. Additionally, it identifies intermediate-risk patients and could be used to implement targeted interventions to facilitate discharge home in this group of patients.

Recent time and motion studies have consistently found that this impact is negligible; whereas qualitative studies have repeatedly revealed negative end-user perceptions suggesting decreased efficiency and disrupted workflow.
We speculate that this discrepancy may be due in part to the design of the time and motion studies, which is focused on measuring clinicians' ‘time expenditures’ among different clinical activities rather than inspecting clinical ‘workflow’ from the true ‘flow of the work’ perspective. In this paper, we present a set of new analytical methods consisting of workflow fragmentation assessments, pattern recognition, and data visualization, which are accordingly designed to uncover hidden regularities embedded in the flow of the work. Through an empirical study, we demonstrate the potential value of these new methods in enriching workflow analysis in clinical settings.},

Patient-oriented workflow models can also provide an understanding of healthcare work taking place in various formal and informal health settings in an integrated manner. We present two cases demonstrating the potential value of patient-oriented workflow models.

Fears that HMOs uniformly lead to worse quality of care are not supported by the evidence, although all quality data were collected prior to the recent round of cost cutting that started in 1992.

Despite positive aspects of online forums as a qualitative research method, very little is known about practical issues involved in using online forums for data collection, especially for a qualitative research project.

Objectives
The purpose of this paper is to describe the practical issues that the researchers encountered in implementing an online forum as a qualitative component of a larger study on cancer pain experience.

Method
Throughout the study process, the research staff recorded issues ranged from minor technical problems to serious ethical dilemmas as they arose and wrote memos about them. The memos and written records of discussions were reviewed and analyzed using the content analysis suggested by Weber.

Results
Two practical issues related to credibility were identified: a high response and retention rate and automatic transcripts. An issue related to dependability was the participants’ easy forgetfulness. The issues related to confirmability were difficulties in theoretical saturation and unstandardized computer and Internet jargon. A security issue related to hacking attempts was noted as well.

Discussion
The analysis of these issues suggests several implications for future researchers who want to use online forums as a qualitative data collection method.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2008.07.006},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study applied a modified version of the extended technology acceptance model (TAM2) to examine the factors determining the acceptance of health IT applications by caregivers in long-term care facilities. The antecedent variables, including social influence factors such as subjective norm and image were examined together with demographic variables including age, job level, long-term care work experience and computer skills in regard to their impact on caregivers' acceptance of health IT applications. METHODS: A self-administered questionnaire was developed based on the validated items from TAM2. The data was collected in a cross-sectional survey using convenience sample. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling techniques were used to validate our causal model. RESULTS: Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and computer skills had significant positive impact, whereas image had significant negative impact on caregivers' intention to use health IT applications. Image, subjective norm and computer skills also indirectly impacted on intention through the mediating factor of ease of use. Ease of use, subjective norm and job level also determined perceived usefulness. The other demographic factors (including age and long-term care work experience) did not have any significant effect on caregivers' acceptance of a health IT application. Our model explains 34\% of caregivers' intention to use an introduced IT application before any hands-on experience with the system established. CONCLUSIONS: The planners and managers should ensure that a health IT application to be introduced into a long-term care facility is useful and easy to use. Effort should be focused on forming a positive social norm for the introduction of the new innovation and improving caregivers' computer skills. Securing the managers' and senior nurses' support for the innovation at the onset of the project is critical for success. Finally the caregivers appear to dislike the idea of increased IT ability will elevate their status.},

	abstract = {EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

In an effort to better understand the current use and adoption rates of electronic health records and other health information technology (HIT) applications within nursing homes, the Division of Health Care Policy and Research at the University of Colorado Denver has been contracted by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop survey instruments for use in long-term care provider settings. Although numerous survey instruments have been fielded to assess HIT use in nursing homes and long-term care settings, the lack of consistent definitions, terminology, item construction, sampling frames, and measurement criteria render it difficult to accurately gauge current HIT adoption. In this report, we review existing surveys for long-term care and other provider settings pertaining to current HIT use and adoption, barriers to adoption, and recommend issues to consider when developing survey questions to ascertain HIT adoption, use, and barriers to adoption and use in nursing homes.

Section I of the deliverable discusses current trends and policy initiatives in HIT for long-term care. Section II summarizes several existing surveys on HIT use and adoption in long-term care settings, compares key findings of the surveys, and discusses measurement issues affecting survey results. Surveys used to assess HIT use and adoption in home health and hospice organizations, ambulatory or physician practices, and hospitals are discussed in Section III to determine if survey items and techniques from other settings could be used in long-term care. The descriptions of survey characteristics and findings were drawn from published papers or web-accessible information. The comparison of survey findings presented in Section II and Section III highlights the assertion that lack of consistency with regard to data items and measurement methods hinders efforts to draw meaningful conclusions from published survey results.

Despite national support for widespread adoption of HIT across health care settings and growing recognition of its value in improving health care safety, quality, and efficiency, HIT adoption continues at a relatively slow pace. Recent efforts have been made to identify barriers contributing to the limited progress in HIT adoption and supply information to help guide the development of policies and incentives to promote more rapid HIT proliferation. In addition to the review of surveys on HIT adoption, we reviewed the literature on barriers to HIT adoption across provider settings. A brief synthesis of existing surveys and literature on barriers is found in Section IV.

Section V provides recommendations for future survey development for long-term care. To reliably ascertain HIT adoption, use, and barriers in nursing homes, two sets of survey questions are recommended: (1) a shorter, core set of questions for possible use in the National Nursing Home Survey sponsored by the National Center for Health Statistics; and (2) an expanded set of questions, which would be made available to industry stakeholder groups for survey administration. The creation of two sets of survey questions will provide both breadth and depth in the collection of information on the adoption of HIT applications in nursing homes. The core set of questions would provide an overview of HIT adoption that could be generalized to the industry as a whole. The expanded, longer set of questions keyed off of the core set of questions would provide in-depth, detailed data on the extent to which specific workflow and health information exchange processes are being adopted. Both sets of questions will provide valuable information to policy makers to assess movement toward the goal of promoting HIT adoption and make informed decisions about the policy actions that are needed to accelerate adoption. Our recommendations on the content and format for the survey questions will guide the remainder of this project.},

	title = {Impact of home care on hospital days: a meta analysis},
	volume = {32},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of home care on hospital days. DATA SOURCES: Search of automated databases covering 1964-1994 using the key words "home care," "hospice," and "healthcare for the elderly." Home care literature review references also were inspected for additional citations. STUDY SELECTION: Of 412 articles that examined impact on hospital use/cost, those dealing with generic home care that reported hospital admissions/cost and used a comparison group receiving customary care were selected (N = 20). STUDY DESIGN: A meta-analytic analysis used secondary data sources between 1967 and 1992. DATA EXTRACTION: Study characteristics that could have an impact on effect size (i.e., country of origin, study design, disease characteristics of study sample, and length of follow-up) were abstracted and coded to serve as independent variables. Available statistics on hospital days necessary to calculate an effect size were extracted. If necessary information was missing, the authors of the articles were contacted. METHODS: Effect sizes and homogeneity of variance measures were calculated using Dstat software, weighted for sample size. Overall effect sizes were compared by the study characteristics described above. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Effect sizes indicate a small to moderate positive impact of home care in reducing hospital days, ranging from 2.5 to 6 days (effect sizes of -.159 and -.379, respectively), depending on the inclusion of a large quasi-experimental study with a large treatment effect. When this outlier was removed from analysis, the effect size for studies that targeted terminally ill patients exclusively was homogeneous across study subcategories; however, the effect size of studies that targeted nonterminal patients was heterogeneous, indicating that unmeasured variables or interactions account for variability. CONCLUSION: Although effect sizes were small to moderate, the consistent pattern of reduced hospital days across a majority of studies suggests for the first time that home care has a significant impact on this costly outcome.},

	title = {Is home health care a substitute for hospital care?},
	volume = {31},
	doi = {10.1080/01621424.2011.644497},
	abstract = {A previous study used aggregate (region-level) data to investigate whether home health care serves as a substitute for inpatient hospital care and concluded that "there is no evidence that services provided at home replace hospital services." However, that study was based on a cross-section of regions observed at a single point of time and did not control for unobserved regional heterogeneity. In this article, state-level employment data are used to reexamine whether home health care serves as a substitute for inpatient hospital care. This analysis is based on longitudinal (panel) data–observations on states in two time periods–which enable the reduction or elimination of biases that arise from use of cross-sectional data. This study finds that states that had higher home health care employment growth during the period 1998-2008 tended to have lower hospital employment growth, controlling for changes in population. Moreover, states that had higher home health care payroll growth tended to have lower hospital payroll growth. The estimates indicate that the reduction in hospital payroll associated with a \$1,000 increase in home health payroll is not less than \$1,542, and may be as high as \$2,315. This study does not find a significant relationship between growth in utilization of home health care and growth in utilization of nursing and residential care facilities. An important reason why home health care may serve as a substitute for hospital care is that the availability of home health care may allow patients to be discharged from the hospital earlier. Hospital discharge data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project are used to test the hypothesis that use of home health care reduces the length of hospital stays. Major Diagnostic Categories with larger increases in the fraction of patients discharged to home health care tended to have larger declines in mean length of stay (LOS). Between 1998 and 2008, mean LOS declined by 4.1\%, from 4.78 to 4.59 days. The estimates are consistent with the hypothesis that this was entirely due to the increase in the fraction of hospital patients discharged to home health care, from 6.4\% in 1998 to 9.9\% in 2008. The estimated reduction in 2008 hospital costs resulting from the rise in the fraction of hospital patients discharged to home health care may have been 36\% larger than the increase in the payroll of the home health care industry.},

	abstract = {Structured AbstractObjective:The objective of the report is to review the evidence on the impact of consumer health informatics (CHI) applications on health outcomes, to identify the knowledge gaps and to make recommendations for future research.Data sources:We searched MEDLINE®, EMBASE®, The Cochrane Library, ScopusTM, and CINAHL® databases, references in eligible articles and the table of contents of selected journals; and query of experts.Methods:Paired reviewers reviewed citations to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of the impact of CHI applications, and all studies that addressed barriers to use of CHI applications. All studies were independently assessed for quality. All data was abstracted, graded, and reviewed by 2 different reviewers.Results:One hundred forty-six eligible articles were identified including 121 RCTs. Studies were very heterogeous and of variable quality.Four of five asthma care studies found significant positive impact of a CHI application on at least one healthcare process measure.In terms of the impact of CHI on intermediate health outcomes, significant positive impact was demonstrated in at least one intermediate health outcome of; all three identified breast cancer studies, 89 percent of 32 diet, exercise, physical activity, not obesity studies, all 7 alcohol abuse studies, 58 percent of 19 smoking cessation studies, 40 percent of 12 obesity studies, all 7 diabetes studies, 88 percent of 8 mental health studies, 25 percent of 4 asthma/COPD studies, and one of two menopause/HRT utilization studies. Thirteen additional single studies were identified and each found evidence of significant impact of a CHI application on one or more intermediate outcomes.Eight studies evaluated the effect of CHI on the doctor patient relationship. Five of these studies demonstrated significant positive impact of CHI on at least one aspect of the doctor patient relationship.In terms of the impact of CHI on clinical outcomes, significant positive impact was demonstrated in at least one clinical outcome of; one of three breast cancer studies, four of five diet, exercise, or physical activity studies, all seven mental health studies, all three identified diabetes studies. No studies included in this review found any evidence of consumer harm attributable to a CHI application.Evidence was insufficient to determine the economic impact of CHI applications.Conclusions:Despite study heterogeneity, quality variability, and some data paucity, available literature suggests that select CHI applications may effectively engage consumers, enhance traditional clinical interventions, and improve both intermediate and clinical health outcomes.},

	abstract = {As the American Recovery and Restoration Act of 2009 allocates \$19 billion to health information technology, it will be useful for health care managers to project the true cost of implementing an electronic health record (EHR). This study presents a step-by-step guide for using activity-based costing (ABC) to estimate the cost of an EHR. ABC is a cost accounting method with a "top-down" approach for estimating the cost of a project or service within an organization. The total cost to implement an EHR includes obvious costs, such as licensing fees, and hidden costs, such as impact on productivity. Unlike other methods, ABC includes all of the organization's expenditures and is less likely to miss hidden costs. Although ABC is used considerably in manufacturing and other industries, it is a relatively new phenomenon in health care. ABC is a comprehensive approach that the health care field can use to analyze the cost-effectiveness of implementing EHRs. In this article, ABC is applied to a health clinic that recently implemented an EHR, and the clinic is found to be more productive after EHR implementation. This methodology can help health care administrators assess the impact of a stimulus investment on organizational performance.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cost analysis in laboratories represents a necessary phase in their scientific progression. AIM: To calculate indirect cost and thus total cost per sample of various tests at Hematopathology laboratory (HPL). SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Activity-based costing (ABC) method is used to calculate per cost test of the hematopathology laboratory. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Information is collected from registers, purchase orders, annual maintenance contracts (AMCs), payrolls, account books, hospital bills and registers along with informal interviews with hospital staff. RESULTS: Cost per test decreases as total number of samples increases. Maximum annual expense at the HPL is on reagents and consumables followed by manpower. Cost per test is higher for specialized tests which interpret morphological or flow data and are done by a pathologist. CONCLUSIONS: Despite several limitations and assumptions, this was an attempt to understand how the resources are consumed in a large size government-run laboratory. The rate structure needs to be revised for most of the tests, mainly for complete blood counts (CBC), bone marrow examination, coagulation tests and Immunophenotyping. This costing exercise is laboratory specific and each laboratory needs to do its own costing. Such an exercise may help a laboratory redesign its costing structure or at least understand the economics involved in the laboratory management.},

The US Department of Veterans Affairs National Center for Patient Safety (NCPS) database contains root cause analysis (RCA) reviews that identify falls resulting in injury in the community and subsequent action plans that may be helpful to prevent future falls. METHODS: A search of the NCPS-database identified RCA reviews where the patient (community-dwelling and long term care elders) fell in the community resulting in moderate to severe injury. Falls occurred in the home, community living center, outpatient clinic, recreational outing, outdoors, or in a vehicle. Thirty-six RCAs from October 2001 through August 2010 were included. Cases were coded on the basis of location of the fall, primary activity of the patient before/during the fall, root causes, action items, outcome measures, and effectiveness of each action. RESULTS: Sixty-seven root causes resulting in 59 actions were identified from the RCA reports. Falls most frequently occurred in the patient's home (41.7\%). The most common activities the individual was engaged in during a fill included getting up from the bed or chair/wheelchair (22.2\%), walking (22.2\%), and transportation in a wheelchair van (14.8\%). Although many actions yielded improved outcomes, the only action that was significantly associated with improvement was changes made to the environment (p = .028). setting activity CONCLUSIONS: The and surrounding fallsthat occur in the that occur in the community and that result in moderate to serious injury were identified along with the events' root causes. The extremely limited number of reports suggests that there may be missed opportunities to conduct an RCA for adverse events that occur among community-dwelling and long term care elders.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Blood utilization has long been suspected to consume more health care resources than previously reported. Incomplete accounting for blood costs has the potential to misdirect programmatic decision making by health care systems. Determining the cost of supplying patients with blood transfusions requires an in-depth examination of the complex array of activities surrounding the decision to transfuse. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: To accurately determine the cost of blood in a surgical population from a health system perspective, an activity-based costing (ABC) model was constructed. Tasks and resource consumption (materials, labor, third-party services, capital) related to blood administration were identified prospectively at two US and two European hospitals. Process frequency (i.e., usage) data were captured retrospectively from each hospital and used to populate the ABC model. RESULTS: All major process steps, staff, and consumables to provide red blood cell (RBC) transfusions to surgical patients, including usage frequencies, and direct and indirect overhead costs contributed to per-RBC-unit costs between \$522 and \$1183 (mean, \$761 +/- \$294). These exceed previously reported estimates and were 3.2- to 4.8-fold higher than blood product acquisition costs. Annual expenditures on blood and transfusion-related activities, limited to surgical patients, ranged from \$1.62 to \$6.03 million per hospital and were largely related to the transfusion rate. CONCLUSION: Applicable to various hospital practices, the ABC model confirms that blood costs have been underestimated and that they are geographically variable and identifies opportunities for cost containment. Studies to determine whether more stringent control of blood utilization improves health care utilization and quality, and further reduces costs, are warranted.},

	abstract = {The primary objective of this study was to determine if a pharmacist-managed anticoagulation monitoring service (AMS) improved the outcomes of patients receiving warfarin in a family practice setting and was cost effective in treating and preventing thromboembolic disorders. A retrospective chart review was performed on all patients at the University of Florida's Family Practice Residency Program who received warfarin pharmacotherapy between October 1, 1988, and December 15, 1993. The outcomes of patients followed by AMS were compared with those of a control group consisting of patients receiving warfarin but followed only by their physician. Outcomes were evaluated based on the number of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic events, as well as unplanned clinic visits, emergency room visits, and hospital admissions. Cost of hospital admissions, emergency room visits, and participation in the AMS were analyzed. During 28 person-years of treatment, control subjects sustained 12 thromboembolic events (2 pulmonary embolisms, 1 cerebrovascular accident, and 9 deep venous thromboses) and 2 minor and 5 major hemorrhagic events. The study group reported two minor hemorrhagic events during a total of 60 person-years. The control group was 20 times more likely than the study group to experience any event (rate ratio 20, 95\% CI 5-87). In addition, hospitalization and emergency room charges indicated an actual cost of \$119,074.95 for the control group's events. The cost to this group for 28 person-years of participation in the AMS would have been \$5040.00. A potential cost avoidance of \$4072.68 per person-year of follow-up may have been possible if these patients had been followed by the AMS. A pharmacist-managed AMS in a family practice setting can result in improved outcomes for patients receiving warfarin and is cost effective.},

	abstract = {Objective The goal of this study was to develop an in-depth understanding of how a health information exchange (HIE) fits into clinical workflow at multiple clinical sites.
Materials and Methods The ethnographic qualitative study was conducted over a 9-month period in six emergency departments (ED) and eight ambulatory clinics in Memphis, Tennessee, USA. Data were collected using direct observation, informal interviews during observation, and formal semi-structured interviews. The authors observed for over 180 h, during which providers used the exchange 130 times.
Results HIE-related workflow was modeled for each ED site and ambulatory clinic group and substantial site-to-site workflow differences were identified. Common patterns in HIE-related workflow were also identified across all sites, leading to the development of two role-based workflow models: nurse based and physician based. The workflow elements framework was applied to the two role-based patterns. An in-depth description was developed of how providers integrated HIE into existing clinical workflow, including prompts for HIE use.
Discussion Workflow differed substantially among sites, but two general role-based HIE usage models were identified. Although providers used HIE to improve continuity of patient care, patient–provider trust played a significant role. Types of information retrieved related to roles, with nurses seeking to retrieve recent hospitalization data and more open-ended usage by nurse practitioners and physicians. User and role-specific customization to accommodate differences in workflow and information needs may increase the adoption and use of HIE.
Conclusion Understanding end users' perspectives towards HIE technology is crucial to the long-term success of HIE. By applying qualitative methods, an in-depth understanding of HIE usage was developed.},

	abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of this study is twofold: (1) to derive a workflow consensus from multiple clinical activity logs and (2) to detect workflow outliers automatically and without prior knowledge from experts.
Methods
Workflow mining is used in this paper to derive consensus workflow from multiple surgical activity logs using tree-guided multiple sequence alignment. To detect outliers, a global pair-wise sequence alignment (Needleman–Wunsch) algorithm is used. The proposed method is validated for Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (LAPCHOL).
Results
An activity log is directly derived for each LAPCHOL surgery from laparoscopic video using an already developed instrument tracking tool. We showed that a generic consensus can be derived from surgical activity logs using multi-alignment. In total 26 surgery logs are used to derive the consensus for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The derived consensus conforms to the main steps of laparoscopic cholecystectomy as described in best practices. Using global pair-wise alignment, we showed that outliers can be detected from surgeries using the consensus and the surgical activity log.
Conclusion
Alignment techniques can be used to derive consensus and to detect outliers from clinical activity logs. Detecting outliers particularly in surgery is a main step to automatically mine and analyse the underlying cause of these outliers and improve surgical practices.},

Methods: Based on own experience and backed up by a literature review, some important problems during IT evaluation in health care together with their reasons, consequences and possible solutions are presented and structured. Results and conclusions: We define three main problem areas—the complexity of the evaluation object, the complexity of an evaluation project, and the motivation for evaluation. Many evaluation problems can be subsumed under those three problem areas. A broadly accepted framework for evaluation of IT in healthcare seems desirable to address those problems. Such a framework should help to formulate relevant questions, to find adequate methods and tools, and to apply them in a sensible way.},

—Pneumonia is a frequent cause of hospitalization and death among elderly patients, but the relationships between processes of care for pneumonia and outcomes are uncertain, making quality improvement a challenge.Objectives.
—To assess quality of care for Medicare patients hospitalized with pneumonia and to determine whether process of care performance is associated with lower 30-day mortality.Design.
—Multicenter retrospective cohort study with medical record review.Setting.
—A total of 3555 acute care hospitals throughout the United States.Patients.
—A total of 14069 patients at least 65 years old hospitalized with pneumonia.Main Outcome Measures.
—Four processes of care: time from hospital arrival to initial antibiotic administration; blood culture collection before initial hospital antibiotics; blood culture collection within 24 hours of hospital arrival; and oxygenation assessment within 24 hours of hospital arrival. Associations between processes of care and 30-day mortality were determined with logistic regression analysis.Results.
—National estimates of process-of-care performance were antibiotic administration within 8 hours of hospital arrival, 75.5\% (95\% confidence interval [Cl], 73.1-77.9); blood cultures before antibiotics, 57.3\% (95\% Cl, 54.5-60.1); initial blood culture collection, 68.7\% (95\% Cl, 66.2-71.2); and initial oxygenation assessment, 89.3\% (95\% Cl, 87.5-90.9). Lower 30-day mortality was associated with antibiotic administration within 8 hours of hospital arrival (odds ratio [OR], 0.85; 95\% Cl, 0.75-0.96) and blood culture collection within 24 hours of arrival (OR, 0.90; 95\% Cl, 0.81-1.00). State and territory performance estimates varied from 49.0\% to 89.7\% for antibiotics given within 8 hours and from 45.6\% to 82.6\% for blood cultures drawn within 24 hours.Conclusions.
—Administering antibiotics within 8 hours of hospital arrival and collecting blood cultures within 24 hours were associated with improved survival. The fact that states varied widely in the performance of these measures suggests that opportunities exist to improve hospital care of elderly patients with pneumonia.},

Design and Methods: Data from 3,041 Canadian and 11,252 U.S. home care clients assessed with the Minimum Data Set—Home Care (MDS-HC) were used to evaluate a series of indicators suggested by international experts and by focus groups conducted in Canada and the United States. Risk adjustment methods were derived and validated using data from Ontario and Michigan. Results: Of the 73 original candidate HCQIs, 22 were retained for the final list of recommended indicators. All but three indicators include risk adjusters based on individual-level covariates. An agency-level risk adjustment was developed to correct for selection and ascertainment bias. Implications: The HCQIs are new tools providing a first step along the path of quality improvement for home care. These indicators can provide high-quality evidence on performance at the agency level and on a regional basis.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate effects on patient outcomes of Outcome-Based Quality Improvement (OBQI), a continuous quality improvement methodology for home health care (HHC). DESIGN: A quasi-experimental design with prospective pre/post and study/control components within two multiyear demonstration trials (occurring from 1995 to 2000) in which 73 home health agencies implemented OBQI, receiving several annual cycles of outcome reports to evaluate and enhance patient outcomes. SETTING: New York and 27 other states. PARTICIPANTS: The study involved 157,548 predominantly older adult patients admitted over 3 years to 54 OBQI agencies from 27 states in the National Demonstration Trial, 105,917 patients admitted over 4 years to 19 OBQI agencies in the New York State Trial, and 248,621 patients admitted over 3 years to non-OBQI control agencies in the 27 demonstration states. INTERVENTION: As a clinical management and administrative intervention, OBQI involves collecting, encoding, and transmitting patient-level health status data to a central source that provides each OBQI agency with a risk-adjusted outcome report comparing the agency's patient outcomes with those from a reference population and with its own outcomes from the prior period. Target outcomes are selected and focused plans of action implemented to change care behaviors. Outcome changes are evaluated through the next report cycle. MEASUREMENTS: Outcome measures include hospitalization rates and improvement and stabilization outcome rates in functional, physiological, emotional/behavioral, and cognitive health. RESULTS: For the National and New York State Demonstration Trials, the risk-adjusted relative rates of decline in hospitalization of 22\% and 26\%, respectively, for OBQI patients over the 3-year and 4-year demonstration periods were significant (P {\textless} .001) and unparalleled by considerably smaller rates of decline for the non-OBQI patients in the 27 states.

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Home health care is the delivery of predominantly medically related services to patients in a home setting rather than in a medical facility. It provides substantial benefits over traditional, hospital-based health care, such as supporting older adults’ independence and quality of life, as well as being more cost-effective. This aspect of the health care industry could be enhanced through increased technological supports. When providing health care in a home setting, formal caregivers, such as certified nursing assistants (CNAs), registered nurses (RNs), physical therapists (PTs), and occupational therapists (OTs), are faced with many challenges that impede their ability to perform their jobs. Technological interventions have the potential to alleviate many of these challenges. However, to achieve this potential, new technologies must be created to meet the needs of home health care providers. To date, these providers’ specific and most critical needs are not thoroughly understood. This understanding can be gained by conducting a detailed needs assessment that captures the common challenges and difficulties that home health care providers encounter. We conducted a needs assessment comprising three phases: (a) an extensive literature review of research regarding the needs of home health providers, both hospital and home-based (CNAs, RNs, PTs, and OTs); (b) subject matter expert interviews with experienced individuals from home health care; and (c) structured interviews with CNAs. We identified several significant sources of frustration and difficulty faced by CNAs including medical device usage, patient education, family involvement, provider isolation, and barriers to communication. This analysis provides an understanding of the challenges confronting home health care providers that can provide guidance for interventions. Future home health care technology can be developed to specifically target these workers’ most urgent needs and allow them to perform their jobs with greater ease. Moreover, RNs, PTs, and OTs can benefit from understanding some of the challenges faced by their teammates in the home health care process.},

Methods: The study has a prospective descriptive design. A questionnaire addressing the information that hospital and home care nurses exchange when patients need continuing care after hospitalization was developed and used. Results: Hospital and home care nurses differed in the way they assessed the structures and content of the information they exchanged, both before and after the EPR implementation. Conclusion and discussion: There is a need to take account of the different organizational contexts within which the two nursing groups work. The organizational context (hospital versus home care) has implications for the nurses' assessment of the information they exchange. In further development of EPR, it is therefore essential to clarify the context-related information needs of the various health care provider groups as part of the commitment to patient safety.},

The aim of this project was to explore the concept of safety in community home health in one health care authority in British Columbia. Methods: A participatory action research approach was employed to explore staff and client safety risks in this environment. In the first phase, three focus groups were held with staff (n = 39) and the data analysed to identify themes. These were validated by additional focus groups. In the second phase, interviews were held with staff followed by chart reviews. Finally, in phase three, an interdisciplinary working group developed a risk identification tool for staff which was subsequently piloted. The exploration focused on answering the following questions: What constitutes safety in community home health care? What are the priority areas for action in relation to safety? What type of risk identification would be most helpful to community health workers to prepare them adequately to meet their clients' and their own safety needs? Results: Risk themes identified included: poor communication, acute care staff not understanding the needs of community staff, working alone, mobility, medication concerns, lack of pre-screening of clients' homes, and community health workers accepting a high degree of risk. Conclusions: Findings suggest that typical notions of safety and risk in acute care are not easily translated into the community sector, that staff and clients' safety concerns are intertwined, and staff require better and more timely information from acute care staff when patients are discharged home.},

Information and communication technology (ICT) are becoming a natural part in healthcare both for delivering and giving accessibility to healthcare for people with chronic illness living at home. Aim. The aim was to review existing studies describing the use of ICT in home care for communication between patients, family members, and healthcare professionals. Methods. A review of studies was conducted that identified 1,276 studies. A selection process and quality appraisal were conducted, which finally resulted in 107 studies. Results. The general results offer an overview of characteristics of studies describing the use of ICT applications in home care and are summarized in areas including study approach, quality appraisal, publications data, terminology used for defining the technology, and disease diagnosis. The specific results describe how communication with ICT was performed in home care and the benefits and drawbacks with the use of ICT. Results were predominated by positive responses in the use of ICT. Conclusion. The use of ICT applications in home care is an expanding research area, with a variety of ICT tools used that could increase accessibility to home care. Using ICT can lead to people living with chronic illnesses gaining control of their illness that promotes self-care.},

A telephone survey of 4,613 Medicare managed care enrollees conducted between April and October of 2000 and linked to administrative claims for a subsequent 12-month period. We estimated a series of logistic regression models to determine which socioeconomic factors were related to home health visits and the use of durable medical equipment (DME) among Medicare managed care enrollees. Controlling for health and demographic differences, Medicare managed care enrollees in the lowest tertile for nonhousing assets had 50 percent greater odds than those in the highest tertile of having one or more home health visits. All else equal, enrollees with less than a high school education had 30 percent lower odds than those who had graduated from high school of using durable medical equipment. Medicare managed care enrollees of low socioeconomic status do not appear to have reduced access to home health visits; however, use of durable medical equipment is considerably lower for enrollees with less than a high school education. Physicians and therapists working with Medicare managed care enrollees may want to actively target DME prescriptions to those with educational disadvantages.},

	abstract = {Managing post-discharge care at home: an analysis of patients’ and their carers’ perceptions of information received during their stay in hospital This small-scale study carried out in a Melbourne metropolitan hospital explored patients’ and their carers’ perceptions of information, adequacy of information, and their utilization of information concerning post-discharge care received from health professionals during their stay in hospital. The research design consisted of two stages. Stage one involved a qualitative approach using focused interviews of five pairs of patients and their carers, 2 weeks after discharge from hospital. Five main themes emerged from the content analysis of the interview transcripts: information given by health professionals to patients and carers, patients’ and carers’ psychological well-being, activities of daily living, caring tasks of the patients, and community linkages. A quantitative approach was used for stage two involving two sets of questionnaires, one for the patient and one for the carer, developed from the themes identified in stage one. A pilot study was conducted on three pairs of patients and their carers, 2 weeks after discharge from hospital. The main study consisted of a convenience sample of 40 pairs of patients and their carers who completed the questionnaires 2 weeks post-discharge. Data analysis of stage two of the study consisted of descriptive statistics and cross-tabulations. The main findings suggested that carers received very little information from health professionals concerning their patients’ health problems and care at home. The carers’ health and employment states were often not considered in their patients’ discharge plan. Carers who were present with their patients when they received information concerning post-discharge care experienced a decrease in anxiety during their patients’ convalescence at home, greater satisfaction with...},

	abstract = {In a majority of settings, rehabilitative services are provided at healthcare facilities by skilled therapists who work as independent contractors. Facilities include hospitals, nursing homes, clinics, and assisted living centers and may be located throughout a wide geographic area. To date, the problem of constructing weekly schedules for the therapists has yet to be fully investigated. This article presents the first algorithm for supporting weekly planning at the agencies that do the contracting. The goal is to better match patient demand with therapist skills while minimizing treatment, travel, administrative and mileage reimbursement costs. The problem was modeled as a mixed-integer program but has several complicating components, including different patient classes, optional weekly treatment patterns and a complex payment structure that frustrated the use of exact methods. Alternatively, a parallel (two-phase) greedy randomized adaptive search procedure was developed that relies on an innovative decomposition scheme and a number of benefit measures that explicitly address the trade-off between feasibility and solution quality. In Phase I, daily routes are constructed for the therapists in parallel and then combined to form weekly schedules. In Phase II, a high-level neighborhood search is executed to converge towards a local optimum. This is facilitated by solving a series of newly formulated traveling salesman problems with side constraints. Extensive testing with both real data provided by a U.S. rehabilitation agency and associated random instances demonstrates the effectiveness of the purposed procedure.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Home health care is the delivery of predominantly medically related services to patients in a home setting rather than in a medical facility. It provides substantial benefits over traditional, hospital-based health care, such as supporting older adults’ independence and quality of life, as well as being more cost-effective. This aspect of the health care industry could be enhanced through increased technological supports. When providing health care in a home setting, formal caregivers, such as certified nursing assistants (CNAs), registered nurses (RNs), physical therapists (PTs), and occupational therapists (OTs), are faced with many challenges that impede their ability to perform their jobs. Technological interventions have the potential to alleviate many of these challenges. However, to achieve this potential, new technologies must be created to meet the needs of home health care providers. To date, these providers’ specific and most critical needs are not thoroughly understood. This understanding can be gained by conducting a detailed needs assessment that captures the common challenges and difficulties that home health care providers encounter. We conducted a needs assessment comprising three phases: (a) an extensive literature review of research regarding the needs of home health providers, both hospital and home-based (CNAs, RNs, PTs, and OTs); (b) subject matter expert interviews with experienced individuals from home health care; and (c) structured interviews with CNAs. We identified several significant sources of frustration and difficulty faced by CNAs including medical device usage, patient education, family involvement, provider isolation, and barriers to communication. This analysis provides an understanding of the challenges confronting home health care providers that can provide guidance for interventions. Future home health care technology can be developed to specifically target these workers’ most urgent needs and allow them to perform their jobs with greater ease. Moreover, RNs, PTs, and OTs can benefit from understanding some of the challenges faced by their teammates in the home health care process.},

Such applications have led to the recognition of some important limits of the Internet, when dealing with telemedicine: (i) no guarantees on the quality of service (QoS); (ii) inadequate security and privacy; (iii) for some countries, low bandwidth and thus low responsiveness for real-time applications. Currently, there are several innovations in the world of the Internet. Different initiatives have been aimed at an amelioration of the Internet protocols, in order to have quality of service, multimedia support, security and other advanced services, together with greater bandwidth.The forthcoming Internet improvements, although induced by electronic commerce, video on demand, and other commercial needs, are of real interest also for telemedicine, because they solve the limits currently slowing down the use of Internet.

This study assessed how nurses cope with care errors and what strategies they use. A survey design was used for this study and 192 home health nurses completed the survey in a southeastern state. Packets containing sealed surveys, a flier, and a description of the study were mailed to the nurses. Results of the study with home health nurses indicate that nurses felt angry at themselves for making the care errors. Planful problem-solving was the most frequently used coping technique followed by accepting responsibility. The most commonly reported change in practice following a care error experience was paying more attention to detail, followed by personally confirming patient data and changing the organisation of data. Intervention research is needed to help nurses better deal and cope with care errors and to better assess the need for providing such nurses with professional support and counselling after becoming involved in a care error experience.},

	abstract = {Background A pay-for-performance scheme based on meeting targets for the quality of clinical care was introduced to family practice in England in 2004. Methods We conducted an interrupted time-series analysis of the quality of care in 42 representative family practices, with data collected at two time points before implementation of the scheme (1998 and 2003) and at two time points after implementation (2005 and 2007). At each time point, data on the care of patients with asthma, diabetes, or coronary heart disease were extracted from medical records; data on patients' perceptions of access to care, continuity of care, and interpersonal aspects of care were collected from questionnaires. The analysis included aspects of care that were and those that were not associated with incentives. Results Between 2003 and 2005, the rate of improvement in the quality of care increased for asthma and diabetes (P{\textbackslash}textless0.001) but not for heart disease. By 2007, the rate of improvement had slowed for all three conditions (P{\textbackslash}textless0.001), and the quality of those aspects of care that were not associated with an incentive had declined for patients with asthma or heart disease. As compared with the period before the pay-for-performance scheme was introduced, the improvement rate after 2005 was unchanged for asthma or diabetes and was reduced for heart disease (P = 0.02). No significant changes were seen in patients' reports on access to care or on interpersonal aspects of care. The level of the continuity of care, which had been constant, showed a reduction immediately after the introduction of the pay-for-performance scheme (P{\textbackslash}textless0.001) and then continued at that reduced level. Conclusions Against a background of increases in the quality of care before the pay-for-performance scheme was introduced, the scheme accelerated improvements in quality for two of three chronic conditions in the short term. However, once targets were reached, the improvement in the quality of care for patients with these conditions slowed, and the quality of care declined for two conditions that had not been linked to incentives. Continuity of care was reduced after the introduction of the scheme.},

To assess the impact of a stand-alone e-prescribing system on the rates and types of ambulatory prescribing errors. Prospective, non-randomized study using pre-post design of 15 providers who adopted e-prescribing with concurrent controls of 15 paper-based providers from September 2005 through June 2007. Use of a commercial, stand-alone e-prescribing system with clinical decision support including dosing recommendations and checks for drug-allergy interactions, drug-drug interactions, and duplicate therapies. Prescribing errors were identified by a standardized prescription and chart review. We analyzed 3684 paper-based prescriptions at baseline and 3848 paper-based and electronic prescriptions at one year of follow-up. For e-prescribing adopters, error rates decreased nearly sevenfold, from 42.5 per 100 prescriptions (95\% confidence interval (CI), 36.7-49.3) at baseline to 6.6 per 100 prescriptions (95\% CI, 5.1-8.3) one year after adoption (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.001). For non-adopters, error rates remained high at 37.3 per 100 prescriptions (95\% CI, 27.6-50.2) at baseline and 38.4 per 100 prescriptions (95\% CI, 27.4-53.9) at one year (p = 0.54). At one year, the error rate for e-prescribing adopters was significantly lower than for non-adopters (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.001). Illegibility errors were very high at baseline and were completely eliminated by e-prescribing (87.6 per 100 prescriptions at baseline for e-prescribing adopters, 0 at one year). Prescribing errors may occur much more frequently in community-based practices than previously reported. Our preliminary findings suggest that stand-alone e-prescribing with clinical decision support may significantly improve ambulatory medication safety.},

	abstract = {AIM: To evaluate the impact of picture archiving and communications systems (PACS) on reporting times and productivity in a large teaching hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Reporting time, defined as the time taken from patient registration to report availabitity, and productivity, defined as the number of reports issued per whole time equivalent (WTE) radiologist per month, were studied for 2 years pre- and 3 years post-PACS installation. Mean reporting time was calculated for plain radiographs and specialist radiology techniques [computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, and nuclear medicine]. Productivity, total department workload, and unreported film rates were also assessed. Pre- and post-PACS findings were compared. RESULTS: Between 2002-2006 the number of radiological patient episodes increased by 30\% from 11,531/month to 15,057/month. This was accompanied by a smaller increase in WTE reporting radiologists, from 32 to 37 (15\%). Mean reporting times have improved substantially post-PACS, plain radiograph reporting time decreased by 26\% (from 6.8 to 5 days; p = 0.002) and specialty modalities by 24\% (4.1 to 3.1 days; p {\textbackslash}textless 0.001). Radiologist productivity has increased by 18\% (337 films to 407 films/WTE radiologist/month). Unreported films have decreased from 5 to 4\% for plain radiographs and are steady for specialty modalities ({\textbackslash}textless 1\%). In most areas improvements have been sustained over a 3-year period. CONCLUSION: Since the introduction of PACS, reporting times have decreased by 25\% and the productivity improved by 18\%. Sustained improvements are felt to reflect the efficiencies and cultural change that accompanied the introduction of PACS and digital dictation. (C) 2008 The Royal College of Radiologists.

As researchers conducting separate studies in the United States, The Netherlands, and Australia, using similar qualitative methods to investigate implementing PCISs, the authors have encountered many instances in which PCIS applications seem to foster errors rather than reduce their likelihood. The authors describe the kinds of silent errors they have witnessed and, from their different social science perspectives (information science, sociology, and cognitive science), they interpret the nature of these errors. The errors fall into two main categories: those in the process of entering and retrieving information, and those in the communication and coordination process that the PCIS is supposed to support. The authors believe that with a heightened awareness of these issues, informaticians can educate, design systems, implement, and conduct research in such a way that they might be able to avoid the unintended consequences of these subtle silent errors.},

	abstract = {Context: The term eHealth is widely used by many individuals, academic institutions, professional bodies, and funding organizations. It has become an accepted neologism despite the lack of an agreed-upon clear or precise definition. We believe that communication among the many individuals and organizations that use the term could be improved by comprehensive data about the range of meanings encompassed by the term. Objective: To report the results of a systematic review of published, suggested, or proposed definitions of eHealth. Data Sources: Using the search query string "eHealth" OR "e-Health" OR "electronic health", we searched the following databases: Medline and Premedline (1966-June 2004), EMBASE (1980-May 2004), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-May 2004), Web of Science (all years), Information Sciences Abstracts (1966-May 2004), Library Information Sciences Abstracts (1969-May 2004), and Wilson Business Abstracts (1982-March 2004). In addition, we searched dictionaries and an Internet search engine. Study Selection: We included any source published in either print format or on the Internet, available in English, and containing text that defines or attempts to define eHealth in explicit terms. Two of us independently reviewed titles and abstracts of citations identified in the bibliographic databases and Internet search, reaching consensus on relevance by discussion. Data Extraction: We retrieved relevant reports, articles, references, letters, and websites containing definitions of eHealth. Two of us qualitatively analyzed the definitions and coded them for content, emerging themes, patterns, and novel ideas. Data Synthesis: The 51 unique definitions that we retrieved showed a wide range of themes, but no clear consensus about the meaning of the term eHealth. We identified 2 universal themes (health and technology) and 6 less general (commerce, activities, stakeholders, outcomes, place, and perspectives). Conclusions: The widespread use of the term eHealth suggests that it is an important concept, and that there is a tacit understanding of its meaning. This compendium of proposed definitions may improve communication among the many individuals and organizations that use the term.},

	abstract = {Objective: Despite the proliferation of consumer health sites, lay individuals often experience difficulty finding health information online. The present study attempts to understand users' information seeking difficulties by drawing on a hypothesis testing explanatory framework. It also addresses the role of user competencies and their interaction with internet resources. Design: Twenty participants were interviewed about their understanding of a hypothetical scenario about a family member suffering from stable angina and then searched MedlinePlus (R) consumer health information portal for information on the problem presented in the scenario. Participants' understanding of heart disease was analyzed via semantic analysis. Thematic coding was used to describe information seeking trajectories in terms of three key strategies: verification of the primary hypothesis, narrowing search within the general hypothesis area and bottom-up search. Results: Compared to an expert model, participants' understanding of heart disease involved different key concepts, which were also differently grouped and defined. This understanding provided the framework for search-guiding hypotheses and results interpretation. Incorrect or imprecise domain knowledge led individuals to search for information on irrelevant sites, often seeking out data to confirm their incorrect initial hypotheses. Online search skills enhanced search efficiency, but did not eliminate these difficulties. Conclusions: Regardless of their web experience and general search skills, lay individuals may experience difficulty with health information searches. These difficulties may be related to formulating and evaluating hypotheses that are rooted in their domain knowledge. Informatics can provide support at the levels of health information portals, individual websites, and consumer education tools.},

	doi = {10.1186/1472-6947-7-16},
	abstract = {Background: Supporting 21st century health care and the practice of evidence-based medicine (EBM) requires ubiquitous access to clinical information and to knowledge-based resources to answer clinical questions. Many questions go unanswered, however, due to lack of skills in formulating questions, crafting effective search strategies, and accessing databases to identify best levels of evidence. Methods: This randomized trial was designed as a pilot study to measure the relevancy of search results using three different interfaces for the PubMed search system. Two of the search interfaces utilized a specific framework called PICO, which was designed to focus clinical questions and to prompt for publication type or type of question asked. The third interface was the standard PubMed interface readily available on the Web. Study subjects were recruited from interns and residents on an inpatient general medicine rotation at an academic medical center in the US. Thirty-one subjects were randomized to one of the three interfaces, given 3 clinical questions, and asked to search PubMed for a set of relevant articles that would provide an answer for each question. The success of the search results was determined by a precision score, which compared the number of relevant or gold standard articles retrieved in a result set to the total number of articles retrieved in that set. Results: Participants using the PICO templates ( Protocol A or Protocol B) had higher precision scores for each question than the participants who used Protocol C, the standard PubMed Web interface. ( Question 1: A = 35\%, B = 28\%, C = 20\%; Question 2: A = 5\%, B = 6\%, C = 4\%; Question 3: A = 1\%, B = 0\%, C = 0\%) 95\% confidence intervals were calculated for the precision for each question using a lower boundary of zero. However, the 95\% confidence limits were overlapping, suggesting no statistical difference between the groups. Conclusion: Due to the small number of searches for each arm, this pilot study could not demonstrate a statistically significant difference between the search protocols. However there was a trend towards higher precision that needs to be investigated in a larger study to determine if PICO can improve the relevancy of search results.},

Furthermore, steps can be taken to improve initially poor intercoder reliability and to reduce the number of iterations required to generate stronger intercoder reliability.},

Nurses reported having data on 7\% to 94\% of the data elements. Whether a lipid profile had been done, the HbA1C (glycosolated hemoglobin test, also called a hemoglobin A1C) levels, or ejection fractions were known for 7\%, 17\%, and 18\%, respectively. When nurses reported information related to ACE-I use (N = 183), they reported that 76\% of patients were on ACE-I (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) or acceptable alternative for heart failure. But no information was reported on ACE-I use for 12\% of the patients (N = 24). Potential solutions to these deficits in information and quality include increased use of guidelines in home care, guideline checklists, information transfer forms, nurse activism to request information, and the adoption of the electronic health record.},

	abstract = {Background
Adolescents present many challenges in providing them effective preventive services and health care. Yet, they are typically the early adopters of new technology (eg, the Internet). This creates important opportunities for engaging youths via eHealth.

Objective
To describe how adolescents use technology for their health-information needs, identify the challenges they face, and highlight some emerging roles of health professionals regarding eHealth services for adolescents.

Methods
Using an inductive qualitative research design, 27 focus groups were conducted in Ontario, Canada. The 210 participants (55\% female, 45\% male; median age 16 years) were selected to reflect diversity in age, sex, geographic location, cultural identity, and risk. An 8-person team analyzed and coded the data according to major themes.

Results
Study participants most-frequently sought or distributed information related to school (89\%), interacting with friends (85\%), social concerns (85\%), specific medical conditions (67\%), body image and nutrition (63\%), violence and personal safety (59\%), and sexual health (56\%). Finding personally-relevant, high-quality information was a pivotal challenge that has ramifications on the depth and types of information that adolescents can find to answer their health questions. Privacy in accessing information technology was a second key challenge. Participants reported using technologies that clustered into 4 domains along a continuum from highly-interactive to fixed information sources: (1) personal communication: telephone, cell phone, and pager; (2) social communication: e-mail, instant messaging, chat, and bulletin boards; (3) interactive environments: Web sites, search engines, and computers; and (4) unidirectional sources: television, radio, and print. Three emerging roles for health professionals in eHealth include: (1) providing an interface for adolescents with technology and assisting them in finding pertinent information sources; (2) enhancing connection to youths by extending ways and times when practitioners are available; and (3) fostering critical appraisal skills among youths for evaluating the quality of health information.

Conclusions
This study helps illuminate adolescent health-information needs, their use of information technologies, and emerging roles for health professionals. The findings can inform the design and more-effective use of eHealth applications for adolescent populations.},

The Visiting Nurse Service of New York (VNSNY), a large not-for-profit home healthcare agency, has integrated technology applications into the service delivery model of several programs. Case studies, including the development and implementation, of three informatics initiatives at VNSNY are presented on: (1) Quality Scorecards that utilize process, outcomes, cost, and satisfaction measures to assess performance among clinical staff and programs; (2) a tool to identify patients at risk of being hospitalized, and (3) a predictive model that identifies patients who are eligible for physical rehabilitation services. Following a description of these initiatives, we discuss their impact on quality and process indicators, as well as the opportunities and challenges to implementation.},

Objective: The objective of this study was to examine methodologic issues encountered as these datasets are used to report the nation's health care in the National Healthcare Quality Report (NHQR) at national and state levels. Findings: Although the reliability of most data elements from MDS and OASIS are considered acceptable in research studies, mixed evidence exists for the reliability and validity of the quality measures themselves. Detection bias can affect the quality measures, particularly for pain and pressure ulcers. Although risk adjustment is used for all measures, effectiveness varies among measures and methods. Additional quality measures such as patient satisfaction, quality of life, and structural measures would be desirable but will require additional data collection efforts. Although the NH measures represent most NH residents, the HHA measures only apply to Medicare and Medicaid patients served by Medicare-certified agencies. Finally, the absence of clinical benchmarks limits the interpretation of the NHQR HHA and NH measures. Conclusions: Further developmental work is needed to address many of these issues to improve the usefulness of these quality measures in future NHQR reports.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To define the risk factors for recurrent falls in the home-dwelling elderly.
DESIGN: A prospective population-based study covering two years.
SETTING: Five rural municipalities around the city Oulu, northern Finland.
PARTICIPANTS: All home-dwelling elderly persons (N = 1,016) aged 70 years or older living in the municipalities.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The risk factors of recurrent falling by variables related to social status, life changes, housing conditions, health, functional abilities and life style, using cross-tabulations and multivariate analyses.
RESULTS: The recurrent fallers (at least two falls within 365 days after the examination day) consisted of 17 men (6\% of the men) and 71 women (14\%). Logistic regression analyses showed female sex, urinary urgency, frequent fear of falling, dizziness, a poor pulse rate rise 30 seconds after standing up and falling during the previous year to be risk factors for recurrent falls. After the variable representing previous falls had been removed from the analysis, urinary incontinence and a change in housing conditions during the past two years emerged and urinary urgency dropped out of the model.
CONCLUSIONS: Women particularly are a target group for the prevention of falls among the elderly. Urinary urgency and urinary incontinence, fear of falling, dizziness and changes in the housing conditions should be inquired about to identify the elderly at risk for falling and to take preventive interventions. In addition to testing blood pressure changes after standing up, the changes in pulse rate should be determined to identify and treat elderly people who have orthostatic conditions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many believe that computerization will improve health care quality, reduce costs, and increase administrative efficiency. However, no previous studies have examined computerization's cost and quality impacts at a diverse national sample of hospitals.
METHODS: We linked data from an annual survey of computerization at approximately 4000 hospitals for the period from 2003 to 2007 with administrative cost data from Medicare Cost Reports and cost and quality data from the 2008 Dartmouth Health Atlas. We calculated an overall computerization score and 3 subscores based on 24 individual computer applications, including the use of computerized practitioner order entry and electronic medical records. We analyzed whether more computerized hospitals had lower costs of care or administration, or better quality. We also compared hospitals included on a list of the "100 Most Wired" with others.
RESULTS: More computerized hospitals had higher total costs in bivariate analyses (r=0.06, P=.001) but not multivariate analyses (P=.69). Neither overall computerization scores nor subscores were consistently related to administrative costs, but hospitals that increased computerization faster had more rapid administrative cost increases (P=.0001). Higher overall computerization scores correlated weakly with better quality scores for acute myocardial infarction (r=0.07, P=.003), but not for heart failure, pneumonia, or the 3 conditions combined. In multivariate analyses, more computerized hospitals had slightly better quality. Hospitals on the "Most Wired" list performed no better than others on quality, costs, or administrative costs.
CONCLUSION: As currently implemented, hospital computing might modestly improve process measures of quality but does not reduce administrative or overall costs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Experts consider health information technology key to improving efficiency and quality of health care.
PURPOSE: To systematically review evidence on the effect of health information technology on quality, efficiency, and costs of health care.
DATA SOURCES: The authors systematically searched the English-language literature indexed in MEDLINE (1995 to January 2004), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and the Periodical Abstracts Database. We also added studies identified by experts up to April 2005.
STUDY SELECTION: Descriptive and comparative studies and systematic reviews of health information technology.
DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently extracted information on system capabilities, design, effects on quality, system acquisition, implementation context, and costs.
DATA SYNTHESIS: 257 studies met the inclusion criteria. Most studies addressed decision support systems or electronic health records. Approximately 25\% of the studies were from 4 academic institutions that implemented internally developed systems; only 9 studies evaluated multifunctional, commercially developed systems. Three major benefits on quality were demonstrated: increased adherence to guideline-based care, enhanced surveillance and monitoring, and decreased medication errors. The primary domain of improvement was preventive health. The major efficiency benefit shown was decreased utilization of care. Data on another efficiency measure, time utilization, were mixed. Empirical cost data were limited.
LIMITATIONS: Available quantitative research was limited and was done by a small number of institutions. Systems were heterogeneous and sometimes incompletely described. Available financial and contextual data were limited.
CONCLUSIONS: Four benchmark institutions have demonstrated the efficacy of health information technologies in improving quality and efficiency. Whether and how other institutions can achieve similar benefits, and at what costs, are unclear.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT
The US Federal Government is investing up to \$29 billion in incentives for meaningful use of electronic health records (EHRs). However, the effect of EHRs on ambulatory quality is unclear, with several large studies finding no effect.

OBJECTIVE
To determine the effect of EHRs on ambulatory quality in a community-based setting.

DESIGN
Cross-sectional study, using data from 2008.

SETTING
Ambulatory practices in the Hudson Valley of New York, with a median practice size of four physicians.

PARTICIPANTS
We included all general internists, pediatricians and family medicine physicians who: were members of the Taconic Independent Practice Association, had patients in a data set of claims aggregated across five health plans, and had at least 30 patients per measure for at least one of nine quality measures selected by the health plans.

IINTERVENTION
Adoption of an EHR.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
We compared physicians using EHRs to physicians using paper on performance for each of the nine quality measures, using t-tests. We also created a composite quality score by standardizing performance against a national benchmark and averaging standardized performance across measures. We used generalized estimation equations, adjusting for nine physician characteristics.

KEY RESULTS
We included 466 physicians and 74,618 unique patients. Of the physicians, 204 (44 \%) had adopted EHRs and 262 (56 \%) were using paper. Electronic health record use was associated with significantly higher quality of care for four of the measures: hemoglobin A1c testing in diabetes, breast cancer screening, chlamydia screening, and colorectal cancer screening. Effect sizes ranged from 3 to 13 percentage points per measure. When all nine measures were combined into a composite, EHR use was associated with higher quality of care (sd 0.4, p = 0.008).

CONCLUSIONS
This is one of the first studies to find a positive association between EHRs and ambulatory quality in a community-based setting.},

DATA SOURCE: The 2011 Physician Workflow study, representative of U.S. office-based physicians.
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional data were used to examine the association of EHR use with enhanced patient care overall and nine specific clinical benefits.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Most physicians with EHRs reported EHR use enhanced patient care overall (78 percent), helped them access a patient's chart remotely (81 percent), and alerted them to a potential medication error (65 percent) and critical lab values (62 percent). Between 30 and 50 percent of physicians reported that EHR use was associated with clinical benefits related to providing recommended care, ordering appropriate tests, and facilitating patient communication. Using EHRs that met Meaningful Use criteria and having 2 or more years of EHR experience were independently associated with reported benefits. Physicians with EHRs meeting Meaningful Use criteria and longer EHR experience were most likely to report benefits across all 10 measures.
CONCLUSIONS: Physicians reported EHR use enhanced patient care overall. Clinical benefits were most likely to be reported by physicians using EHRs meeting Meaningful Use criteria and longer EHR experience.},

The success of these initiatives required managerial, administrative, and clinical processes that were efficient, effective, and equitable. Adequate information was considered essential, not only to facilitate the tasks but also for short and long term monitoring.

mHealth is enjoying considerable interest and private investment in the United States. A small but growing body of evidence indicates some promise in supporting healthy behavior change and self-management of long-term conditions. The unique benefits mobile phones bring to health initiatives, such as direct access to health information regardless of time or location, may create specific issues for the implementation of such initiatives. Other issues may be shared with general health information technology developments.

Objective
To determine the important issues facing the implementation of mHealth from the perspective of those within the US health system and those working in mHealth in the United States.

Methods
Semistructured interviews were conducted with 27 key informants from across the health and mHealth sectors in the United States. Interviewees were approached directly following an environmental scan of mHealth in the United States or recommendation by those working in mHealth.

Results
The most common issues were privacy and data security, funding, a lack of good examples of the efficacy and cost effectiveness of mHealth in practice, and the need for more high-quality research. The issues are outlined and categorized according to the environment within which they predominantly occur: policy and regulatory environments; the wireless industry; the health system; existing mHealth practice; and research.

Conclusions
Many of these issues could be addressed by making the most of the current US health reform environment, developing a strategic and coordinated approach, and seeking to improve mHealth practice.},

The review covered the use of health information technologies and systems in both medical care (i.e. clinical and surgical) and other areas such as allied health and preventive services. Studies were included in the review if they examined the impact of Electronic Health Record (EHR), Computerised Provider Order-Entry (CPOE), or Decision Support System (DS); and if the primary outcomes of the studies were focused on the level of compliance with evidence-based guidelines among clinicians. Measurements considered relevant to the review were either of changes in clinical processes resulting from a change of the providers' behaviour, or of specific patient outcomes that demonstrated the effectiveness of a particular treatment given by providers. Of 23 studies included in the current review, 17 assessed the impact of HIT/HIS on health care practitioners' performance. A positive improvement, in relation to their compliance with evidence-based guidelines, was seen in 14 studies. Studies that included an assessment of patient outcomes, however, showed insufficient evidence of either clinically or statistically important improvements. Although the number of studies reviewed was relatively small, the findings demonstrated consistency with similar previous reviews of this nature in that wide scale use of HIT has been shown to increase clinician's adherence to guidelines.},

Therefore, we aimed to support systematic systems analysis in health care by developing a comprehensive framework that presents and describes potential areas of analysis.
METHODS: A framework for systems analysis in health care was developed and applied in a health care setting. To provide a clear structure, the framework describes the potential views and levels of systems analyses in a health care environment.
RESULTS: The framework comprises five views (roles and responsibilities, information processing and tools, communication, business processes, teams structure and cooperation) and five levels of analysis (overall organization, organizational unit, staff member, role, task). The framework was successfully applied in an analysis of the structures and processes of the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry of the University Medical Center Heidelberg.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed comprehensive framework aims to structure the views and levels of systems analysis in the complex health care environment. Our first experiences support the usefulness of such a framework.},

	abstract = {BackgroundBackground Shared decision making (SDM) is a process by which a healthcare choice is made jointly by the practitioner and the patient and is said to be the crux of patient-centred care. Policy makers perceive SDM as desirable because of its potential to a) reduce overuse of options not clearly associated with benefits for all (e.g., prostate cancer screening); b) enhance the use of options clearly associated with benefits for the vast majority (e.g., cardiovascular risk factor management); c) reduce unwarranted healthcare practice variations; d) foster the sustainability of the healthcare system; and e) promote the right of patients to be involved in decisions concerning their health. Despite this potential, SDM has not yet been widely adopted in clinical practice. ObjectivesObjectives To determine the effectiveness of interventions to improve healthcare professionals’ adoption of SDM. Search methodsSearch methods We searched the following electronic databases up to 18 March 2009: Cochrane Library (1970-), MEDLINE (1966-), EMBASE (1976-), CINAHL (1982-) and PsycINFO (1965-). We found additional studies by reviewing a) the bibliographies of studies and reviews found in the electronic databases; b) the clinicaltrials.gov registry; and c) proceedings of the International Shared Decision Making Conference and the conferences of the Society for Medical Decision Making. We included all languages of publication. Selection criteriaSelection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or well-designed quasi-experimental studies (controlled clinical trials, controlled before and after studies, and interrupted time series analyses) that evaluated any type of intervention that aimed to improve healthcare professionals' adoption of shared decision making. We defined adoption as the extent to which healthcare professionals intended to or actually engaged in SDM in clinical practice or/and used interventions known to facilitate SDM. We deemed studies eligible if the primary outcomes were evaluated with an objective measure of the adoption of SDM by healthcare professionals (e.g., a third-observer instrument). Data collection and analysisData collection and analysis At least two reviewers independently screened each abstract for inclusion and abstracted data independently using a modified version of the EPOC data collection checklist. We resolved disagreements by discussion. Statistical analysis considered categorical and continuous primary outcomes. We computed the standard effect size for each outcome separately with a 95\% confidence interval. We evaluated global effects by calculating the median effect size and the range of effect sizes across studies. Main resultsMain results The reviewers identified 6764 potentially relevant documents, of which we excluded 6582 by reviewing titles and abstracts. Of the remainder, we retrieved 182 full publications for more detailed screening. From these, we excluded 176 publications based on our inclusion criteria. This left in five studies, all RCTs. All five were conducted in ambulatory care: three in primary clinical care and two in specialised care. Four of the studies targeted physicians only and one targeted nurses only. In only two of the five RCTs was a statistically significant effect size associated with the intervention to have healthcare professionals adopt SDM. The first of these two studies compared a single intervention (a patient-mediated intervention: the Statin Choice decision aid) to another single intervention (also patient-mediated: a standard Mayo patient education pamphlet). In this study, the Statin Choice decision aid group performed better than the standard Mayo patient education pamphlet group (standard effect size = 1.06; 95\% CI = 0.62 to 1.50). The other study compared a multifaceted intervention (distribution of educational material, educational meeting and audit and feedback) to usual care (control group) (standard effect size = 2.11; 95\% CI = 1.30 to 2.90). This study was the only one to report an assessment of barriers prior to the elaboration of its multifaceted intervention. Authors' conclusionsAuthors' conclusions The results of this Cochrane review do not allow us to draw firm conclusions about the most effective types of intervention for increasing healthcare professionals' adoption of SDM. Healthcare professional training may be important, as may the implementation of patient-mediated interventions such as decision aids. Given the paucity of evidence, however, those motivated by the ethical impetus to increase SDM in clinical practice will need to weigh the costs and potential benefits of interventions. Subsequent research should involve well-designed studies with adequate power and procedures to minimise bias so that they may improve estimates of the effects of interventions on healthcare professionals' adoption of SDM. From a measurement perspective, consensus on how to assess professionals' adoption of SDM is desirable to facilitate cross-study comparisons.},

	abstract = {Hospices have been expected to reduce health expenditures since their addition to the US Medicare benefit package in the early-1980s, but the literature on their ability to do so is mixed. The contradictory findings noted in previous studies may be due to selection bias and the period of cost comparison used. Accounting for these, this study focuses on the length of hospice use that maximizes reductions in medical expenditures near death. We used a retrospective, case/control study of Medicare decedents (1993–2003, National Long Term Care Survey screening sample) to compare 1819 hospice decedents, with 3638 controls matched via their predicted likelihood of dying while using a hospice. Variables used to create matches were demographic, primary medical condition, cost of Medicare financed care prior to the last year of life, nursing home residence and Medicaid eligibility.
Hospice use reduced Medicare program expenditures during the last year of life by an average of \$2309 per hospice user; expenditures after initiation of hospice were \$7318 for hospice users compared to \$9627 for controls (P{\textless}0.001). On average, hospice use reduced Medicare expenditures during all but 2 of hospice users’ last 72 days of life; about \$10 on the 72nd day prior to death, with savings increasing to more than \$750 on the day of death. Maximum cumulative expenditure reductions differed by primary condition. The maximum reduction in Medicare expenditures per user was about \$7000, which occurred when a decedent had a primary condition of cancer and used a hospice for their last 58–103 days of life. For other primary conditions, the maximum savings of around \$3500 occurred when a hospice was used for the last 50–108 days of life. Given the length of hospice use observed in the Medicare program, increasing the length of hospice use for 7 in 10 Medicare hospice users would increase savings.},

	abstract = {Despite growing interest in measurement of health care quality and patient experience, the current evidence base largely derives from adult health settings, at least in part because of the absence of appropriately developed measurement tools for adolescents. To rectify this, we set out to develop a conceptual framework and a set of indicators to measure the quality of health care delivered to adolescents in hospital.
A conceptual framework was developed from the following four elements: (1) a review of the evidence around what young people perceive as “adolescent-friendly” health care; (2) an exploration with adolescent patients of the principles of patient-centered care; (3) a scoping review to identify core clinical practices around working with adolescents; and (4) a scoping review of existing conceptual frameworks. Using criteria for indicator development, we then developed a set of indicators that mapped to this framework.
Embedded within the notion of patient- and family-centered care, the conceptual framework for adolescent-friendly health care (quality health care for adolescents) was based on the constructs of experience of care (positive engagement with health care) and evidence-informed care. A set of 14 indicators was developed, half of which related to adolescents' and parents' experience of care and half of which related to aspects of evidence-informed care.
The conceptual framework and indicators of quality health care for adolescents set the stage to develop measures to populate these indicators, the next step in the agenda of improving the quality of health care delivered to adolescents in hospital settings.},

We first identify the computer-mediated paradox, as it exists in the tele-home health care setting. Specifically, we address the challenges of providing quality patient inclusive of affective assessment. From the design science perspective, we then introduce an intelligent interface (MOUE) aimed at discerning emotional state from processing sensory modalities (or modes) input via various media and building (or encoding) a model of the user's emotions. We contextualize MOUE within the tele-home health care setting to provide the health care provider with an easy-to-use and useful assessment of the patient's emotional state in order to facilitate patient care. We then use an IS adoption model developed and tested in the general telemedicine context in a qualitative exploratory manner as a means to inform design science regarding adapting affective state output in consideration of tele-home health adoption and diffusion issues. Based upon this integrative exploration, we propose to expand the application of "Wizard of Oz" type studies by Dahlback, N., et al., (1998) to computer-mediated communication (CMC) environments to investigate how emotional state assessments influence responses from health care professionals and how MOUE can be accepted into the health care environment.},

It gave SSMHC's people the tools and techniques to make improvements, created an environment of teamwork, and introduced the concept of improving processes. Using the Baldrige Criteria for Performance Excellence as a business model helped SSMHC to see how various organizational functions should link and to discover gaps in the linkage within its own organization. Baldrige feedback reports identified opportunities that could then be prioritized and the resulting improvements implemented. Overall, the Baldrige model gave a focused approach to what had been scattered improvement efforts. SSM Health Care considers the Baldrige model the best way for an organization to get better faster.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study examines the relationships among organizational culture, quality improvement processes and selected outcomes for a sample of up to 61 U. S. hospitals. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SETTING: Primary data were collected from 61 U. S. hospitals (located primarily in the midwest and the west) on measures related to continuous quality improvement/total quality management (CQI/TQM), organizational culture, implementation approaches, and degree of quality improvement implementation based on the Baldrige Award criteria. These data were combined with independently collected data on perceived impact and objective measures of clinical efficiency (i.e., charges and length of stay) for six clinical conditions. STUDY DESIGN: The study involved cross-sectional examination of the named relationships. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: Reliable and valid scales for the organizational culture and quality improvement implementation measures were developed based on responses from over 7,000 individuals across the 61 hospitals with an overall completion rate of 72 percent. Independent data on perceived impact were collected from a national survey and independent data on clinical efficiency from a companion study of managed care. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A participative, flexible, risk-taking organizational culture was significantly related to quality improvement implementation. Quality improvement implementation, in turn, was positively associated with greater perceived patient outcomes and human resource development. Larger-size hospitals experienced lower clinical efficiency with regard to higher charges and higher length of stay, due in part to having more bureaucratic and hierarchical cultures that serve as a barrier to quality improvement implementation. CONCLUSIONS: What really matters is whether or not a hospital has a culture that supports quality improvement work and an approach that encourages flexible implementation. Larger-size hospitals face more difficult challenges in this regard.},

	abstract = {Context Organized care management processes (CMPs) can improve health care quality
for patients with chronic diseases. The Institute of Medicine of the National
Academy of Sciences has called for public and private purchasers of health
care to create incentives for physician organizations (POs) to use CMPs and
for the government to assist POs in implementing information technology (IT)
to facilitate CMP use. Research is lacking about the extent to which POs use
CMPs or about the degree to which incentives, IT, or other factors are associated
with their use.Objectives To determine the extent to which POs with 20 or more physicians use
CMPs and to identify key factors associated with CMP use for 4 chronic diseases
(asthma, congestive heart failure, depression, and diabetes).Design, Setting, and Participants One thousand five hundred eighty-seven US POs (medical groups and independent
practice associations) with 20 or more physicians were identified using 5
large databases. One thousand one hundred four of these POs (70\%) agreed to
participate in a telephone survey conducted between September 2000 and September
2001. Sixty-four responding POs were excluded because they did not treat any
of the 4 diseases, leaving 1040 POs.Main Outcome Measures Extent of use of CMPs as calculated on the basis of a summary measure,
a PO care management index (POCMI; range, 0-6) and factors associated with
CMP use.Results Physician organizations' mean use of CMPs was 5.1 of a possible 16;
50\% used 4 or fewer. External incentives and clinical IT were most strongly
associated with CMP use. Controlling for other factors, use of the 2 most
strongly associated incentives—public recognition and better contracts
for health care quality—was associated with use of 1.3 and 0.7 additional
CMPs, respectively (P{\textless}.001 and P = .007). Each additional IT capability was associated with 0.37 additional
CMPs (P{\textless}.001). However, 33\% of POs reported no
external incentives and 50\% reported no clinical IT capability.Conclusions The use of CMPs varies greatly among POs, but it is low on average.
Government and private purchasers of health care may increase CMP use by providing
external incentives for improvement of health care quality to POs and by assisting
them in improving their clinical IT capability.},

	abstract = {With the enormous investments in Information Technology (IT), the question of payoffs from IT has become increasingly important. Organizations continue to question the benefits from IT investments especially in conjunction with corporate initiatives such as business process reengineering (BPR). Furthermore, the impact of technology on nonflnancial outcomes such as customer satisfaction and quality is gaining interest. However, studies examining the IT-performance relationship have been far from conclusive. The difficulty in identifying impacts from technology has been the isolation of benefits of IT from other factors that may also contribute to organizational performance. Furthermore, benefits from technology investments may be realized over an extended period of time. Finally, IT benefits may accrue when they are done in concert with other organizational initiatives such as business process reengineering. This calls for studies that take into account control variables as well as data that span time periods. In this study, we examine monthly data collected from eight hospitals over a recent three-year time period. We specify propositions that relate investments in IT to performance, and the combined effect of technology and BPR on performance. We draw upon the literature in health-care management to incorporate appropriate control variables in the analyses. Our results provide support for the IT-performance relationship that is observed after certain time lags. Such a relationship may not be evident in cross-sectional or snapshot data analyses. Also, results indicate support for the impact of technology contingent on BPR practiced by hospitals.},

Home telemonitoring figures among the various solutions that could help attenuate some of the problems associated with aging populations, rates of chronic illness, and shortages of health professionals.

Objective
The primary aim of this study was to further our understanding of the clinical effects associated with home telemonitoring programs in the context of chronic diseases.

Methods
We conducted a systematic review which covered studies published between January 1966 and December 2008. MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, and the INAHTA (International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment) database were consulted. Our inclusion criteria consisted of: (1) English language publications in peer-reviewed journals or conference proceedings and (2) studies involving patients with diabetes, asthma, heart failure, or hypertension, and presenting results on the clinical effects of home telemonitoring.

Results
In all, 62 empirical studies were analyzed. The results from studies involving patients with diabetes indicated a trend toward patients with home telemonitoring achieving better glycemic control. In most trials in which patients with asthma were enrolled, results showed significant improvements in patients’ peak expiratory flows, significant reductions in the symptoms associated with this illness, and improvements in perceived quality of life. Virtually all studies involving patients with hypertension demonstrated the ability of home telemonitoring to reduce systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure. Lastly, due to the equivocal nature of current findings of home telemonitoring involving patients with heart failure, larger trials are still needed to confirm the clinical effects of this technology for these patients.

Conclusions
Although home telemonitoring appears to be a promising approach to patient management, designers of future studies should consider ways to make this technology more effective as well as controlling possible mediating variables.},

	abstract = {Objective: To estimate the incidence and direct medical costs for fatal and non-fatal fall injuries among US adults aged ⩾65 years in 2000, for three treatment settings stratified by age, sex, body region, and type of injury.
Methods: Incidence data came from the 2000 National Vital Statistics System, 2001 National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-All Injury Program, 2000 Health Care Utilization Program National Inpatient Sample, and 1999 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Costs for fatal falls came from Incidence and economic burden of injuries in the United States; costs for non-fatal falls were based on claims from the 1998 and 1999 Medicare fee-for-service 5\% Standard Analytical Files. A case crossover approach was used to compare the monthly costs before and after the fall.
Results: In 2000, there were almost 10 300 fatal and 2.6 million medically treated non-fatal fall related injuries. Direct medical costs totaled \$0.2 billion dollars for fatal and \$19 billion dollars for non-fatal injuries. Of the non-fatal injury costs, 63\% (\$12 billion) were for hospitalizations, 21\% (\$4 billion) were for emergency department visits, and 16\% (\$3 billion) were for treatment in outpatient settings. Medical expenditures for women, who comprised 58\% of the older adult population, were 2–3 times higher than for men for all medical treatment settings. Fractures accounted for just 35\% of non-fatal injuries but 61\% of costs.
Conclusions: Fall related injuries among older adults, especially among older women, are associated with substantial economic costs. Implementing effective intervention strategies could appreciably decrease the incidence and healthcare costs of these injuries.},

They must develop expertise in these care models and be able to guide safe and efficient transitions. This article describes a 9-week educational series designed to review the evidence base and practical aspects of implementing key services that span the continuum of care for older adults. The sessions in the series covered geriatric assessment, ambulatory care, acute hospital, house call, hospital-at-home, Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly, assisted living, inpatient consultation, rehabilitation, nursing home, chronic hospital, and palliative care and hospice. To assess the educational effect of these sessions, evaluations were collected at the end of each session, including one “summative evaluation” after the completion of the entire 9-week series. The vast majority (97\%) of survey responses evaluating individual sessions were positive (scores of 4 or 5 on a 5-point Likert scale), and 89\% of responses on the summative evaluation were in that range. This educational series efficiently provides a sequential “tour” of health services for older adults, allowing learners to appreciate the continuum of geriatric care models and relationships between services. Feedback from attendees suggests that this format increases knowledge of health services along the continuum of care for older adults and does so in an efficient manner for learners at different levels of training.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The use of information technology (IT), such as computerized medical records (CMR), has been proposed as a method for increasing the efficiency of delivered services, raising the level of the quality of care provided, and decreasing the number of medical errors. Research on IT and CMRs in health care has focused primarily on hospitals and physicians' offices, and there currently exists no nationally representative information for home health and hospice agencies. This report provides the first nationally representative estimates of the prevalence of CMR use in home health and hospice agencies in the United States in 2000.
METHODS: Data are from the 2000 National Home and Hospice Care Survey. Data presented include estimates of home health and hospice agencies that are currently using or planning to use a CMR in the next year. CMR use is also presented by agency characteristics.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 32\% of all agencies were using a CMR. Nearly one-third of home health agencies (32.1\%), one-fifth of hospice agencies (18.6\%), and two-fifths of mixed-type agencies (offering both services) (40.3\%) reported using a CMR. Number of current active patients and provision of "high technology" services (e.g., respiratory, intravenous, or enterostomal therapy) were significantly associated with use of CMRs. While 23.0\% of agencies with 50 or fewer patients reported use of a CMR, the proportion almost doubled to 44.8\%, among agencies with 100 or more patients. Over one-third (34.8\%) of agencies that provided high technology services reported using a CMR, compared with one-fifth (20.8\%) of agencies that did not provide high technology services. No other agency characteristics were found to have a significant relationship with CMR use.},

	abstract = {Background: In the context of limited resources, evidence on costs and cost-effectiveness of alternative methods of delivering health-care services is increasingly important to facilitate appropriate resource allocation. Palliative care services have been expanding worldwide with the aim of improving the experience of patients with terminal illness at the end of life through better symptom control, coordination of care and improved communication between professionals and the patient and family. Aim: To present results from a comprehensive literature review of available international evidence on the costs and cost-effectiveness of palliative care interventions in any setting (e.g. hospital-based, home-based and hospice care) over the period 2002–2011. Design: Key bibliographic and review databases were searched. Quality of retrieved papers was assessed against a set of 31 indicators developed for this review. Data Sources: PubMed, EURONHEED, the Applied Social Sciences Index and the Cochrane library of databases. Results: A total of 46 papers met the criteria for inclusion in the review, examining the cost and/or utilisation implications of a palliative care intervention with some form of comparator. The main focus of these studies was on direct costs with little focus on informal care or out-of-pocket costs. The overall quality of the studies is mixed, although a number of cohort studies do undertake multivariate regression analysis. Conclusion: Despite wide variation in study type, characteristic and study quality, there are consistent patterns in the results.

	abstract = {This paper describes an intelligent home healthcare system characterized by a wireless sensor network (WSN) and a reasoning component. The aim of the system is to allow constant and unobtrusive monitoring of a patient in order to enhance autonomy and increase quality of life. Data collected by the sensor network are used to support a reasoning component, which is based on answer set programming (ASP), in performing three main reasoning tasks: (i) continuous contextualization of the physical, mental and social state of a patient, (ii) prediction of possibly risky situations and (iii) identification of plausible causes for the worsening of a patient's health. Starting from different data sources (sensor data, test results, inference results) the reasoning component applies expressive logic rules aimed at correct interpretation of incomplete or inconsistent contextual information, and evaluates correlation rules expressed by clinicians. The expressive power of ASP allows efficient enough reasoning to support prevention, while declarativity simplifies rule-specification and allows automatic encoding of knowledge. Preliminary evaluations show that the combination of an ASP-based reasoning component and a WSN is a good solution for creating a home-based healthcare system.},

Intercoder reliability can be used as a proxy for the validity of constructs that emerge from the data. Popular methods for establishing intercoder reliability involve presenting predetermined text segments to coders. Using this approach, researchers run the risk of altering meanings by lifting text from its original context, or making interpretations about the length of codable text. This article describes a set of procedures that was used to develop and assess intercoder reliability with free-flowing text data, in which the coders themselves determined the length of codable text segments. Content analysis of open-ended interview data collected from twenty third-generation Japanese American men and women generated an intercoder reliability of more than .80 for fifteen of the seventeen themes, an average agreement of .90 across all themes, and consistency among the coders in how they segmented coded text. The findings suggest that these procedures may be useful for validating the conclusions drawn from other qualitative studies using text data.},

To test the effectiveness of two interventions designed to improve the adoption of evidence-based practices by home health nurses caring for heart failure (HF) patients.Data Sources/Study Setting. Information on nurse practices was abstracted from the clinical records of patients admitted between June 2000 and November 2001 to the care of 354 study nurses at a large, urban, nonprofit home care agency.Study Design. The study employed a randomized design with nurses assigned to usual care or one of two intervention groups upon identification of an eligible patient. The basic intervention was a one-time e-mail reminder highlighting six HF-specific clinical recommendations. The augmented intervention consisted of the initial e-mail reminder supplemented by provider prompts, patient education material, and clinical nurse specialist outreach.Data Collection. At each home health visit provided by a study nurse to an eligible HF patient during the 45-day follow-up period, a structured chart abstraction tool was used to collect information on whether the nurse provided the care practices highlighted in the e-mail reminder.Principal Findings. Both the basic and the augmented interventions greatly increased the practice of evidence-based care, according to patient records, in the areas of patient assessment and instructions about HF disease management. While not all results were statistically significant at conventional levels, intervention effects were positive in virtually all cases and effect magnitudes frequently were large.Conclusions. The results of this randomized trial strongly support the efficacy of just-in-time evidence-based reminders as a means of changing clinical practice among home health nurses who are geographically dispersed and spend much of their time in the field.},

We first identify the computer-mediated paradox, as it exists in the tele-home health care setting. Specifically, we address the challenges of providing quality patient inclusive of affective assessment. From the design science perspective, we then introduce an intelligent interface (MOUE) aimed at discerning emotional state from processing sensory modalities (or modes) input via various media and building (or encoding) a model of the user's emotions. We contextualize MOUE within the tele-home health care setting to provide the health care provider with an easy-to-use and useful assessment of the patient's emotional state in order to facilitate patient care. We then use an IS adoption model developed and tested in the general telemedicine context in a qualitative exploratory manner as a means to inform design science regarding adapting affective state output in consideration of tele-home health adoption and diffusion issues. Based upon this integrative exploration, we propose to expand the application of "Wizard of Oz" type studies by Dahlback, N., et al., (1998) to computer-mediated communication (CMC) environments to investigate how emotional state assessments influence responses from health care professionals and how MOUE can be accepted into the health care environment.},

ObjectivesObjectives To explore the effectiveness of smart home technologies as an intervention for people with physical disability, cognitive impairment or learning disability, who are living at home, and to consider the impact on the individual's health status and on the financial resources of health care. Search methodsSearch methods We searched the following databases for primary studies: (a) the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group Register, (b) the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), (The Cochrane Library, issue 1, 2007), and (c) bibliographic databases, including MEDLINE (1966 to March 2007), EMBASE (1980 to March 2007) and CINAHL (1982 to March 2007). We also searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE). We searched the electronic databases using a strategy developed by the EPOC Trials Search Co-ordinator. Selection criteriaSelection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-experimental studies, controlled before and after studies (CBAs) and interrupted time series analyses (ITS). Participants included adults over the age of 18, living in their home in a community setting. Participants with a physical disability, dementia or a learning disability were included. The included interventions were social alarms, electronic assistive devices, telecare social alert platforms, environmental control systems, automated home environments and 'ubiquitous homes'. Outcome measures included any objective measure that records an impact on a participant's quality of life, healthcare professional workload, economic outcomes, costs to healthcare provider or costs to participant. We included measures of service satisfaction, device satisfaction and healthcare professional attitudes or satisfaction.

Purpose To develop a HIT-based data infrastructure that serves multiple hospice and palliative care sites, meeting clinical and administrative needs with data, technical, and analytic support. Methods Through a multi-site academic/community partnership, a data infrastructure was collaboratively developed, pilot-tested at a community-based site, refined, and demonstrated for data collection and preliminary analysis. Additional sites, which participated in system development, became prepared to contribute data to the growing aggregate database. Results Electronic data collection proved feasible in community-based hospice and palliative care. The project highlighted “success factors” for implementing HIT in this field: engagement of site-based project “champions” to promote the system from within; involvement of stakeholders at all levels of the organization, to promote culture change and buy-in; attention to local needs (e.g., data for quality reporting) and requirements (e.g., affordable cost, efficiency); consideration of practical factors (e.g., potential to interfere with clinical flow); provision of adequate software, technical, analytic, and statistical support; availability of flexible HIT options (e.g., different data-collection platforms); and adoption of a consortium approach in which sites can support one another, learn from each others' experiences, pool data, and benefit from economies of scale.

We sought to measure the correlates of EHR adoption. Design Mailed survey to a stratified random sample of all medical practices in Massachusetts in 2005, with one physician per practice randomly selected for survey. Measurements EHR adoption rates. Results The response rate was 71\% (1345/1884). Overall, while 45\% of physicians were using an EHR, EHRs were present in only 23\% of practices. In multivariate analysis, practice size was strongly correlated with EHR adoption; 52\% of practices with 7 or more physicians had an EHR, as compared with 14\% of solo practices (adjusted odds ratio, 3.66; 95\% confidence interval, 2.28–5.87). Hospital-based practices (adjusted odds ratio, 2.44; 95\% confidence interval, 1.53–3.91) and practices that teach medical students or residents (adjusted odds ratio, 2.30; 95\% confidence interval, 1.60–3.31) were more likely to have an EHR. The most frequently cited barriers to adoption were start-up financial costs (84\%), ongoing financial costs (82\%), and loss of productivity (81\%). Conclusions While almost half of physicians in Massachusetts are using an EHR, fewer than one in four practices in Massachusetts have adopted EHRs. Adoption rates are lower in smaller practices, those not affiliated with hospitals, and those that do not teach medical students or residents. Interventions to expand EHR use must address both financial and non-financial barriers, especially among smaller practices.},

We conducted a 12-month pilot trial of home telemonitoring. Patients were randomly assigned to the control and intervention groups. Patients in the control group showed no clear differences in quality of life at the end of the trial. The telehealth group showed a consistent trend towards improved quality of life on several instruments, including the SF-36, the St George Respiratory Questionnaire and the K10 questionnaire; the improvement in the latter was significant. Hospitalizations were reduced in both the control (−19\%) and telehealth group (−25\%). Patient interviews indicated that the technology was acceptable to most patients and their families, including the Māori. The results from the pilot trial suggest that wider implementation with a cost benefit evaluation could be worthwhile.},

	abstract = {Objectives The purpose of this study was threefold. First, we gathered and synthesized the historic literature regarding electronic health record (EHR) adoption rates among physicians in small practices (ten or fewer members). Next, we constructed models to project estimated future EHR adoption trends and timelines. We then determined the likelihood of achieving universal EHR adoption in the near future and articulate how barriers can be overcome in the small and solo practice medical environment. Design This study used EHR adoption data from six previous surveys of small practices to estimate historic market penetration rates. Applying technology diffusion theory, three future adoption scenarios, optimistic, best estimate, and conservative, are empirically derived. Measurement EHR adoption parameters, external and internal coefficients of influence, are estimated using Bass diffusion models. Results All three EHR scenarios display the characteristic diffusion S curve that is indicative that the technology is likely to achieve significant market penetration, given enough time. Under current conditions, EHR adoption will reach its maximum market share in 2024 in the small practice setting. Conclusion The promise of improved care quality and cost control has prompted a call for universal EHR adoption by 2014. The EHR products now available are unlikely to achieve full diffusion in a critical market segment within the time frame being targeted by policy makers.},

Low birth rates and rapid increases in the percentages of elderly people make aging and aged care one of the top-priority issues among the national agenda of many countries. The responses of governments have included initiatives to extend productive working lives and promote self-funded retirement; to promote healthy, active aging; and to encourage more care to be delivered in home and community settings. Technology will be a major enabler of these strategies. People requiring health services are increasingly being offered more care in their own homes and community settings as an alternative to hospital admission and to delay or avoid moving into institutional care. Research is providing intelligent technology to enable care in the home as well as to monitor safety, security, and quality. Innovation will provide greater independence and better access to care in their own homes for the elderly, sufferers of chronic illness, and persons with disability and reduce the incidence of hospital admissions and the length of stay when admissions do occur. Technologies will support families and professional caregivers and are expected to reduce costs. This paper reports on developments in technology to support care for the aged in home and community settings.},

Twenty-five hospice employees participated. Eighteen (72\%) were in clinical positions and seven were in non-clinical positions (28\%). Thirty-nine percent of respondents reported no videophone training, despite the fact that every employee had received training. Only four staff members actually used a videophone with patients. The respondents overwhelmingly stated that they had the organizational resources necessary to use the videophone and that it was easy to operate. Despite initial enthusiasm, leaders in the hospice agency did not endorse the videophones for work, nor offer incentives for using the videophones or providing them to patients. It is important to note that videophone technology is not meant to replace face-to-face visits, but to supplement them and to provide an additional tool for the nurses.},

But no information was reported on ACE-I use for 12\% of the patients (N = 24). Potential solutions to these deficits in information and quality include increased use of guidelines in home care, guideline checklists, information transfer forms, nurse activism to request information, and the adoption of the electronic health record.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2008.07.006},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study applied a modified version of the extended technology acceptance model (TAM2) to examine the factors determining the acceptance of health IT applications by caregivers in long-term care facilities. The antecedent variables, including social influence factors such as subjective norm and image were examined together with demographic variables including age, job level, long-term care work experience and computer skills in regard to their impact on caregivers' acceptance of health IT applications. METHODS: A self-administered questionnaire was developed based on the validated items from TAM2. The data was collected in a cross-sectional survey using convenience sample. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling techniques were used to validate our causal model. RESULTS: Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and computer skills had significant positive impact, whereas image had significant negative impact on caregivers' intention to use health IT applications. Image, subjective norm and computer skills also indirectly impacted on intention through the mediating factor of ease of use. Ease of use, subjective norm and job level also determined perceived usefulness. The other demographic factors (including age and long-term care work experience) did not have any significant effect on caregivers' acceptance of a health IT application. Our model explains 34\% of caregivers' intention to use an introduced IT application before any hands-on experience with the system established. CONCLUSIONS: The planners and managers should ensure that a health IT application to be introduced into a long-term care facility is useful and easy to use. Effort should be focused on forming a positive social norm for the introduction of the new innovation and improving caregivers' computer skills. Securing the managers' and senior nurses' support for the innovation at the onset of the project is critical for success. Finally the caregivers appear to dislike the idea of increased IT ability will elevate their status.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of home care on hospital days. DATA SOURCES: Search of automated databases covering 1964-1994 using the key words "home care," "hospice," and "healthcare for the elderly." Home care literature review references also were inspected for additional citations. STUDY SELECTION: Of 412 articles that examined impact on hospital use/cost, those dealing with generic home care that reported hospital admissions/cost and used a comparison group receiving customary care were selected (N = 20). STUDY DESIGN: A meta-analytic analysis used secondary data sources between 1967 and 1992. DATA EXTRACTION: Study characteristics that could have an impact on effect size (i.e., country of origin, study design, disease characteristics of study sample, and length of follow-up) were abstracted and coded to serve as independent variables. Available statistics on hospital days necessary to calculate an effect size were extracted. If necessary information was missing, the authors of the articles were contacted. METHODS: Effect sizes and homogeneity of variance measures were calculated using Dstat software, weighted for sample size. Overall effect sizes were compared by the study characteristics described above. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Effect sizes indicate a small to moderate positive impact of home care in reducing hospital days, ranging from 2.5 to 6 days (effect sizes of -.159 and -.379, respectively), depending on the inclusion of a large quasi-experimental study with a large treatment effect. When this outlier was removed from analysis, the effect size for studies that targeted terminally ill patients exclusively was homogeneous across study subcategories; however, the effect size of studies that targeted nonterminal patients was heterogeneous, indicating that unmeasured variables or interactions account for variability. CONCLUSION: Although effect sizes were small to moderate, the consistent pattern of reduced hospital days across a majority of studies suggests for the first time that home care has a significant impact on this costly outcome.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Use and Acceptance of an Electronic Health Record: Factors Affecting Physician Attitudes Mary Elizabeth Morton Susan Wiedenbeck, Ph.D. and Katherine W. McCain, Ph.D. The benefits of using electronic health records (EHRs) are well-documented; however, a number of implementation barriers have impeded their widespread use. The literature provides evidence of failed clinical system implementations, due to lack of adoption by users. Health care organizations must be prepared to anticipate and manage changes that will accompany implementation of a new information system. As the key coordinator and provider of patient care, physician acceptance of an EHR application will determine the overall success of a product's implementation. The objective of this study was to determine the individual characteristics and sociotechnical factors that may contribute to physician acceptance of an EHR. A hypothesized causal model grounded in Diffusion of Innovations theory and the Technology Acceptance Model was developed using case study and survey methods, and was tested using structural equation modeling (SEM). An online survey was distributed to 802 faculty, fellow and resident physicians in an acute care teaching institution in the southeastern United States. Overall response rate was 29.8\%. The model variables explained over 73\% of the variance in EHR attitude and acceptable model fit was achieved. Individual physician characteristics did not correlate with attitudes in this population. Factors contributing to physician acceptance include: management support, physician involvement in selection and implementation, xiii perceptions of the EHR's impact on physician autonomy, doctor-patient relationship, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. Study participants also expressed concerns about perceptions of the EHR's potential negative impact on clinical workflow and efficiency. Adequate training was not a significant predictor of attitudes. Significant contributions of this study include development of an EHR Acceptance Model for assessing physician attitudes prior to EHR implementation. Other healthcare institutions may find this framework useful for assessing EHR readiness. The findings may aid software developers in designing products to accommodate multiple clinical specialties and user skill levels. The results provide empirical support for a theory about the impact of sociotechnical factors on physician attitudes about EHR adoption.},

	abstract = {Medical care at the end of life consumes 10\% to 12\% of the total health care budget and 27\% of the Medicare budget. Many people claim that increased use of hospice and advance directives and lower use of high-technology interventions for terminally ill patients will produce significant cost savings. However, the studies on cost savings from hospice and advance directives are not definitive. The 3 randomized trials show no savings from these interventions, but either they are too small for confidence in their negative results or their intervention and cost accounting are flawed. The nonrandomized trials of hospice and advance directives show a wide range of savings, from 68\% to none. Five methodological issues obscure the assessment of these studies: (1) selection bias in those patients who use hospice and advance directives, (2) the different time frames of assessing the costs, (3) the limited types of medical costs evaluated, (4) the variability of reporting the savings, and (5) the lack of generalizability of the findings to other patient populations. A more definitive study that assessed patients' end-of-life care preferences, use of hospice and advance directives, and direct and indirect costs would be desirable. In the absence of such a study, the existing data suggest that hospice and advance directives can save between 25\% and 40\% of health care costs during the last month of life, with savings decreasing to 10\% to 17\% over the last 6 months of life and decreasing further to 0\% to 10\% over the last 12 months of life. These savings are less than most people anticipate. Nevertheless, they do indicate that hospice and advance directives should be encouraged because they certainly do not cost more and they provide a means for patients to exercise their autonomy over end-of-life decisions.(JAMA. 1996;275:1907-1914)},

Background: Although home healthcare nurses include clients and family members in decision-making about care, few publications address the nature of interactions among triads of clients, caregivers and nurses in home health care and the association between decision-making and those interactions. Method: The data presented in this paper are a secondary analysis of data originally collected in 1994. The sample included 157 decision-making situations identified from interactions of seven triads of older home healthcare clients, their caregivers and nurses. Qualitative data were collected by participant observation and audiorecording of admission visit interactions among clients, caregivers and nurses. Content analysis, augmented by Ethnograph software, was used to analyse the data. Findings: Coalitions were evident in just eight of the 157 decision-making situations. All of the theoretically possible types of nursing care decisions (programme, operational control, agenda) were observed. Each coalition involved one nursing care decision; two coalitions formed in one triad. Seven coalitions formed between nurse and caregiver against client during two programme and five operational control decisions. One coalition formed between client and caregiver against nurse during an agenda decision. No coalitions formed between client and nurse against caregiver. Conclusions: Although the study sample was small, the findings expand understanding of the relation between types of decisions and formation of coalitions during triadic interactions in home health care, and provided empirical support for a portion of the Theory of Collaborative Decision-Making in Nursing Practice for Triads.

	abstract = {Background We examined deaths of Medicare beneficiaries in Massachusetts and California to evaluate the effect of managed care on the use of hospice and site of death and to determine how hospice affects the expenditures for the last year of life.Methods Medicare data for beneficiaries in Massachusetts (n = 37 933) and California (n = 27 685) who died in 1996 were merged with each state's death certificate files to determine site and cause of death. Expenditure data were Health Care Financing Administration payments and were divided into 30-day periods from the date of death back 12 months.Results In Massachusetts, only 7\% of decedents were enrolled in managed care organizations (MCOs); in California, 28\%. More than 60\% of hospice users had cancer. Hospice use was much lower in Massachusetts than in California (12\% vs 18\%). In both states, decedents enrolled in MCOs used hospice care much more than those enrolled in fee-for-service plans (17\% vs 11\% in Massachusetts and 25\% vs 15\% in California). This pattern persisted for those with cancer and younger (aged 65-74 years) decedents. Decedents receiving hospice care were significantly (P{\textbackslash}textless.001 for both) less likely to die in the hospital (11\% vs 43\% in Massachusetts and 5\% vs 43\% in California). Enrollment in MCOs did not affect the proportion of in-hospital deaths (those enrolled in fee-for-service plans vs MCOs: 40\% vs 39\% in Massachusetts; and 37\% vs 34\% in California). Expenditures in the last year of life were \$28 588 in Massachusetts and \$27 814 in California; about one third of the expenditures occurred in the last month before death. Hospital services accounted for more than 50\% of all expenditures in both states, despite 77\% of decedents being hospitalized in Massachusetts and just 55\% being hospitalized in California. Among patients with cancer, expenditures were 13\% to 20\% lower for those in hospice.Conclusions Medicare-insured decedents in California were more than 4 times more likely to be enrolled in MCOs, were 50\% more likely to use a hospice, and had a 30\% lower hospitalization rate than decedents in Massachusetts, yet there are few differences in out-of-hospital deaths or expenditures in the last year of life. However, patients with cancer using hospice did have significant savings.},

They must develop expertise in these care models and be able to guide safe and efficient transitions. This article describes a 9-week educational series designed to review the evidence base and practical aspects of implementing key services that span the continuum of care for older adults. The sessions in the series covered geriatric assessment, ambulatory care, acute hospital, house call, hospital-at-home, Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly, assisted living, inpatient consultation, rehabilitation, nursing home, chronic hospital, and palliative care and hospice. To assess the educational effect of these sessions, evaluations were collected at the end of each session, including one “summative evaluation” after the completion of the entire 9-week series. The vast majority (97\%) of survey responses evaluating individual sessions were positive (scores of 4 or 5 on a 5-point Likert scale), and 89\% of responses on the summative evaluation were in that range. This educational series efficiently provides a sequential “tour” of health services for older adults, allowing learners to appreciate the continuum of geriatric care models and relationships between services. Feedback from attendees suggests that this format increases knowledge of health services along the continuum of care for older adults and does so in an efficient manner for learners at different levels of training.},

PubMed was searched for publications relevant to discussed topics. Search engines returned vast numbers of hits, and identifying trustworthy sites was difficult. Products judged as trustworthy were classified as information, decision tool, or extended interaction tool. Sites with useful educational material were relatively plentiful; decision guides or interactive tools were much rarer. Available consumer informatics did not address some terminal illnesses very well, and some subpopulations such as children, nor was there sufficient attention to literacy levels or principles of instructional design. Online or published information about usage numbers, effectiveness, and cost/benefit considerations was scant. Many sectors, including commercial, government, healthcare, research, and wellness/advocacy groups, have created consumer informatics for palliation. Online information about palliation is available, although identifying trustworthy sources can be problematic. General information sites are relatively plentiful, but more tools for decision making, and interaction would increase value of web resources. More attention to literacy levels, instructional principles, and needs of special populations would improve products.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the technical quality of videoconferencing used in hospice to engage caregivers as "virtual" members of interdisciplinary team meetings and their impressions of telehealth. Furthermore, it aims to compare the quality of plain old telephone service (POTS) and Web-based videoconferencing and provide recommendations for assessing video quality for telehealth group interactions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were obtained from an ongoing randomized clinical trial exploring Web-based videoconferencing and a completed prospective study of POTS-based videoconferencing in hospice. For the assessment of the technical quality, an observation form was used. Exit interviews with caregivers assessed impressions with the use of telehealth. A retrospective analysis of video-recorded team meetings was conducted rating attributes essential for the quality of videoconferencing (e.g., video artifacts, sharpness). RESULTS: In total, 200 hospice team meetings were analyzed, including 114 video-recorded team meetings using Web-based videoconferencing and 86 meetings using POTS videophones. A direct comparison between the two modalities indicates the superiority of Web-based video in image quality but less so in audio quality. Transcripts of 19 caregiver interviews were analyzed. Caregivers found the use of videoconferencing to be a positive experience and a useful and essential tool to communicating with the hospice team. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the potential of telehealth to improve communication in hospice and the need for new tools that capture the quality of video-mediated communication among multiple stakeholders and strategies to improve the ongoing documentation of telehealth group sessions' technical quality.},

Although telehospice research has been conducted over the last 10 years, little is known about the comprehensive findings within the field. The purpose of this systematic article was to focus on available research and answer the question, What is the state of the evidence related to telehospice services? The article was limited to studies that had been published in the English language and indexed between January 1, 2000 and March 23, 2010. Indexed databases included PubMed and PsycINFO and contained specified key words. Only research published in peer review journals and reporting empirical data, rather than opinion or editorials, were included. A two-part scoring framework was modified and applied to assess the methodological rigor and pertinence of each study. Scoring criteria allowed the evaluation of both quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Twenty-six studies were identified with the search strategy. Although limited in number and in strength, studies have evaluated the use of a variety of technologies, attitudes toward use by providers and consumers, clinical outcomes, barriers, readiness, and cost. A small evidence base for telehospice has emerged over the last 10 years. Although the evidence is of medium strength, its pertinence is strong. The evidence base could be strengthened with randomized trials and additional clinical-outcome-focused research in larger randomized samples and in qualitative studies with better-described samples.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate hospice providers' attitudes and perceptions regarding videophone technology in settings where the technology was introduced but underutilized. Specifically, the project seeks to provide an in-depth understanding of attitudes and perceptions that may lead to failure of a telehealth implementation in the hospice setting in the context of the technology acceptance model. Two hospice agencies were selected as a purposive sample. Both agencies had acquired videophones that were meant to be integrated into care delivery but ultimately were underutilized or never used. Interviews with staff were conducted over the telephone. The interview guide was constructed to capture staff perceptions and attitudes concerning videophone technology. Interviews were audiotaped and transcribed for content analysis. A total of 17 (n = 17) participants (2 hospice administrators, 1 hospice management staff, 10 nurse case managers, and 4 social workers) were interviewed. Participants found videophones to be useful in hospice care but expressed specific practical challenges, such as lack of equipment reliability, lack of human resources, and lack of clarity pertaining to caregiver eligibility criteria. While perceived usefulness of videophones was high among respondents, practical concerns can be interpreted as lack of perceived ease of use. Findings indicate that the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) provides a good framework for an understanding of telehealth underutilization. Staff perceived that videophones were useful, but they were discouraged by their perception that the videophones were not reliable or easy to use and by their uncertainty about the cases that they were best suited for. Lessons learned are integrated into a randomized clinical trial currently under development.},

Information included treatments, nutrition, prognosis, end-of-life care, cost of care, symptoms, and support (social, emotional, spiritual, or physical). A greater proportion of postings sought information after the FAQ module was added, although questions about medical treatment decreased, whereas questions about prognosis and end-of-life care nearly doubled. There was no difference in the proportion of postings addressing support. Medical treatment was the most common treatment reported and pain was the most common symptom reported.

In this study, we employed the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology as the basis for determining what predicts patients' acceptance (measured by behavioral intention) and perceived effective use of a web-based, interactive self-management innovation among home care patients. Design Cross-sectional secondary analysis of data from a randomized field study evaluating a technology-assisted home care nursing practice with adults with chronic cardiac disease. Measurement and analysis A questionnaire was designed based on validated measurement scales from prior research and was completed by 101 participants for measuring the acceptance constructs as part of the parent study protocol. Latent variable modeling with item parceling guided assessment of patients' acceptance. Results Perceived usefulness accounted for 53.9\% of the variability in behavioral intention, the measure of acceptance. Together, perceived usefulness, health care knowledge, and behavioral intention accounted for 68.5\% of the variance in perceived effective use. Perceived ease of use and subjective norm indirectly influenced behavioral intention, through perceived usefulness. Perceived ease of use and subjective norm explained 48\% of the total variance in perceived usefulness. Conclusion The study demonstrates that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, subjective norm, and healthcare knowledge together predict most of the variance in patients' acceptance and self-reported use of the web-based self-management technology.},

	doi = {10.1111/j.1365-2648.2006.04043.x},
	abstract = {AIM: The aim of this paper is to identify the broad epistemological debates which underpin conflicting statements on 'rigour' and 'good practice' in qualitative research; to relate divergences in statements of 'good practice' in focus group design made by the pre-eminent commentators on focus group methodology to these broader epistemological debates; and to stimulate further reflection on the range of possible uses for focus groups in health services research. Considerations of the analysis of focus group data are beyond the scope of this paper. DISCUSSION: Focus groups are a popular form of qualitative data collection, and may be defined as a particular form of group interview intended to exploit group dynamics. While qualitative research may be broadly characterized as concerned with exploring people's lived experiences and perspectives in context, it is a heterogeneous field incorporating many theoretical traditions. Consequently, qualitative researchers may be informed by a wide range of assumptions about the nature of knowledge (epistemology). These assumptions, whether implicit or explicit, have important consequences for claims about rigour and 'good practice' in data collection. Thus, while there is broad agreement over the general form of focus groups, statements of 'good practice' in terms of its application are varied. A close reading of texts by the two pre-eminent commentators on the practical application of focus groups identifies differences in 'best practice' focus group design related to their respective epistemological assumptions, and differences principally related to sampling techniques, composition of groups, the perceived role of group interaction and the nature of inference. CONCLUSION: Explicit consideration of the epistemological basis of divergent statements of 'best practice' in focus group design forces health services researchers to balance the demands of theory with the practicalities of conducting focus group research within complex host organisations; and encourages readers to apply appraisal criteria appropriate to the stated intentions of researchers.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To identify and describe physicians' beliefs about use of electronic medical records (EMR) and computerized provider order entry (CPOE) for inpatient and outpatient care, to build an understanding of what factors shape information technology (IT) use behavior in the unique context of health care delivery. METHODS: Semi-structured qualitative research interviews were carried out, following the beliefs elicitation approach. Twenty physicians from two large Midwest US hospitals participated. Physicians were asked questions to elicit beliefs and experiences pertaining to their use of EMR and CPOE. Questions were based on a broad set of behavior-shaping beliefs and the methods commonly used to elicit those beliefs. RESULTS: Qualitative analysis revealed numerous themes related to the perceived emotional and instrumental outcomes of EMR and CPOE use; perceived external and personal normative pressure to use those systems; perceived volitional control over use behavior; perceived facilitators and barriers to system use; and perceptions about the systems and how they were implemented. EMR and CPOE were commonly believed to both improve and worsen the ease and quality of personal performance, productivity and efficiency, and patient outcomes. Physicians felt encouraged by employers and others to use the systems but also had personal role-related and moral concerns about doing so. Perceived facilitators and barriers were numerous and had their sources in all aspects of the work system. CONCLUSION: Given the breadth and detail of elicited beliefs, numerous design and policy implications can be identified. Additionally, the findings are a first step toward developing a theory of health IT acceptance and use contextualized to the unique setting of health care.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper reviews the research literature on electronic health record (EHR) systems. The aim is to find out (1) how electronic health records are defined, (2) how the structure of these records is described, (3) in what contexts EHRs are used, (4) who has access to EHRs, (5) which data components of the EHRs are used and studied, (6) what is the purpose of research in this field, (7) what methods of data collection have been used in the studies reviewed and (8) what are the results of these studies. Methods: A systematic review was carried out of the research dealing with the content of EHRs. A literature search was conducted on four electronic databases: Pubmed/Medline, Cinalh, Eval and Cochrane. Results: The concept of EHR comprised a wide range of information systems, from files compiled in single departments to longitudinal collections of patient data. Only very few papers offered descriptions of the structure of EHRs or the terminologies used. EHRs were used in primary, secondary and tertiary care. Data were recorded in EHRs by different groups of health care professionals. Secretarial staff also recorded data from dictation or nurses' or physicians' manual notes. Some information was also recorded by patients themselves; this information is validated by physicians. It is important that the needs and requirements of different users are taken into account in the future development of information systems. Several data components were documented in EHRs: daily charting, medication administration, physical assessment, admission nursing note, nursing care plan, referral, present complaint (e.g. symptoms), past medical history, life style, physical examination, diagnoses, tests, procedures, treatment, medication, discharge, history, diaries, problems, findings and immunization. In the future it will be necessary to incorporate different kinds of standardized instruments, electronic interviews and nursing documentation systems in EHR systems. The aspects of information quality most often explored in the studies reviewed were the completeness and accuracy of different data components. It has been shown in several studies that the use of an information system was conducive to more complete and accurate documentation by health care professionals. The quality of information is particularly important in patient care, but EHRs also provide important information for secondary purposes, such as health policy planning. Studies focusing on the content of EHRs are needed, especially studies of nursing documentation or patient self-documentation. One future research area is to compare the documentation of different health care professionals with the core information about EHRs which has been determined in national health projects. The challenge for ongoing national health record projects around the world is to take into account all the different types of EHRs and the needs and requirements of different health care professionals and consumers in the development of EHRs. A further challenge is the use of international terminologies in order to achieve semantic interoperability. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Electronic health records have the potential to improve the delivery of health care services. However, in the United States, physicians have been slow to adopt such systems. This study assessed physicians' adoption of outpatient electronic health records, their satisfaction with such systems, the perceived effect of the systems on the quality of care, and the perceived barriers to adoption. Methods: In late 2007 and early 2008, we conducted a national survey of 2758 physicians, which represented a response rate of 62\%. Using a definition for electronic health records that was based on expert consensus, we determined the proportion of physicians who were using such records in an office setting and the relationship between adoption and the characteristics of individual physicians and their practices. Results: Four percent of physicians reported having an extensive, fully functional electronic-records system, and 13\% reported having a basic system. In multivariate analyses, primary care physicians and those practicing in large groups, in hospitals or medical centers, and in the western region of the United States were more likely to use electronic health records. Physicians reported positive effects of these systems on several dimensions of quality of care and high levels of satisfaction. Financial barriers were viewed as having the greatest effect on decisions about the adoption of electronic health records. Conclusions: Physicians who use electronic health records believe such systems improve the quality of care and are generally satisfied with the systems. However, as of early 2008, electronic systems had been adopted by only a small minority of U.S. physicians, who may differ from later adopters of these systems.},

	abstract = {Background: Considerable investments are being made in commercial electronic prescribing systems (e-prescribing) in many countries. Few studies have measured or evaluated their effectiveness at reducing prescribing error rates, and interactions between system design and errors are not well understood, despite increasing concerns regarding new errors associated with system use. This study evaluated the effectiveness of two commercial e-prescribing systems in reducing prescribing error rates and their propensities for introducing new types of error. Methods and Results: We conducted a before and after study involving medication chart audit of 3,291 admissions (1,923 at baseline and 1,368 post e-prescribing system) at two Australian teaching hospitals. In Hospital A, the Cerner Millennium e-prescribing system was implemented on one ward, and three wards, which did not receive the e-prescribing system, acted as controls. In Hospital B, the iSoft MedChart system was implemented on two wards and we compared before and after error rates. Procedural (e.g., unclear and incomplete prescribing orders) and clinical (e.g., wrong dose, wrong drug) errors were identified. Prescribing error rates per admission and per 100 patient days; rates of serious errors (5-point severity scale, those {\textbackslash}textgreater= 3 were categorised as serious) by hospital and study period; and rates and categories of postintervention "system-related” errors (where system functionality or design contributed to the error) were calculated. Use of an e-prescribing system was associated with a statistically significant reduction in error rates in all three intervention wards (respectively reductions of 66.1\% [95\% CI 53.9\%-78.3\%]; 57.5\% [33.8\%-81.2\%]; and 60.5\% [48.5\%-72.4\%]). The use of the system resulted in a decline in errors at Hospital A from 6.25 per admission (95\% CI 5.23-7.28) to 2.12 (95\% CI 1.71-2.54; p{\textbackslash}textless0.0001) and at Hospital B from 3.62 (95\% CI 3.30-3.93) to 1.46 (95\% CI 1.20-1.73; p{\textbackslash}textless0.0001). This decrease was driven by a large reduction in unclear, illegal, and incomplete orders. The Hospital A control wards experienced no significant change (respectively -12.8\% [95\% CI -41.1\% to 15.5\%]; -11.3\% [-40.1\% to 17.5\%]; -20.1\% [-52.2\% to 12.4\%]). There was limited change in clinical error rates, but serious errors decreased by 44\% (0.25 per admission to 0.14; p = 0.0002) across the intervention wards compared to the control wards (17\% reduction; 0.30-0.25; p = 0.40). Both hospitals experienced system-related errors (0.73 and 0.51 per admission), which accounted for 35\% of postsystem errors in the intervention wards; each system was associated with different types of system-related errors. Conclusions: Implementation of these commercial e-prescribing systems resulted in statistically significant reductions in prescribing error rates. Reductions in clinical errors were limited in the absence of substantial decision support, but a statistically significant decline in serious errors was observed. System-related errors require close attention as they are frequent, but are potentially remediable by system redesign and user training. Limitations included a lack of control wards at Hospital B and an inability to randomize wards to the intervention.},

Attempts to integrate such knowledge into clinical practice are still in the early stages, and as a result, many questions surround the current state of this translation. Objective To synthesize current information on genetic health services for common adult- onset conditions by examining studies that have addressed the outcomes, consumer information needs, delivery, and challenges in integrating these services. Data Sources MEDLINE articles published between January 2000 and February 2008. Study Selection Original research articles and systematic reviews dealing with common chronic adult- onset conditions were reviewed. A total of 3371 citations were reviewed, 170 articles retrieved, and 68 articles included in the analysis. Data Extraction Data were independently extracted by one reviewer and checked by another with disagreement resolved by consensus. Variables assessed included study design and 4 key areas: outcomes of genomic medicine, consumer information needs, delivery of genomic medicine, and challenges and barriers to integration of genomic medicine. Data Synthesis Sixty- eight articles contributed data to the synthesis: 5 systematic reviews, 8 experimental studies, 35 surveys, 7 pre/ post studies, 3 observational studies, and 10 qualitative reports. Three systematic reviews, 4 experimental studies, and 9 additional studies reported on outcomes of genetic services. Generally there were modest positive effects on psychological outcomes such as worry and anxiety, behavioral outcomes have shown mixed results, and clinical outcomes were less well studied. One systematic review, 1 randomized controlled trial, and 14 other studies assessed consumer information needs and found in general that genetics knowledge was reported to be low but that attitudes were generally positive. Three randomized controlled trials and 13 other studies assessed how genomic medicine is delivered and newer models of delivery. One systematic review and 19 other studies assessed barriers; the most consistent finding was the self- assessed inadequacy of the primary care work-force to deliver genetic services. Additional identified barriers included lack of oversight of genetic testing and concerns about privacy and discrimination. Conclusion Many gaps in knowledge about organization, clinician, and patient needs must be filled to translate basic and clinical science advances in genomics of common chronic diseases into practice.},

	doi = {10.1136/jamia.2009.000026},
	abstract = {Objective Many healthcare organizations follow data protection policies that specify which patient identifiers must be suppressed to share "de-identified" records. Such policies, however, are often applied without knowledge of the risk of "re-identification". The goals of this work are: (1) to estimate re-identification risk for data sharing policies of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule; and (2) to evaluate the risk of a specific re-identification attack using voter registration lists. Measurements We define several risk nietrics: (1) expected number of re-identifications; (2) estimated proportion of a population in a group of size g or less, and (31 monetary cost per re-identification. For each US state, we estimate the risk posed to hypothetical datasets, protected by the HIPAA Safe Harbor and Limited Dataset policies by an attacker with full knowledge of patient identifiers and with limited knowledge in the form of voter registries. Results The percentage of a state's population estimated to be vulnerable to unique re-identification lie, g=1) when protected via Safe Harbor and Limited Datasets ranges from 0.01\% to 0.25\% and 10\% to 60\%, respectively. In the voter attack, this number drops for many states, and for some states is 0\%, due to the variable availability of voter registries in the real world. We also find that re-identification cost ranges from \$0 to \$17000, further confirming risk variability. Conclusions This work illustrates that blanket protection policies, such as Safe Harbor, leave different organizations vulnerable to re-identification at different rates. It provides justification for locally performed re-identification risk estimates prior to sharing data.},

Current understanding of the dynamic nature of chronic illnesses, their effects on health over time, and the ability to manage them in the community are limited to measuring a set of variables at discrete points in time, which does not account for the dynamic interactions between physiological systems and the environments of daily life. Recent developments of sensors, data recorders, and communication networks allow the unprecedented measurements of physiological and sociological data for use in geriatrics care. This article identifies and discusses the important issues regarding the use of monitoring technologies in elderly patients. The goals are fourfold. First, some emerging technology that may improve the lives of older adults and improve care are highlighted. Second, the possible applications of technology in geriatrics settings are discussed, with a focus on acute falls, dementia, and cardiac conditions. Third, real and perceived concerns in using monitoring technology are identified and addressed, including technology adoption by elderly people; stigma; and the reduction in social contact; ethical concerns of privacy, autonomy, and consent; concerns of clinicians, including information overload, licensure, and liability; current reimbursement schemes for using technology; and the reliability and infrastructure needed for monitoring technology. Fourth, future approaches to make monitoring technology useful and available in geriatrics are recommended.},

Such applications collect, store, and analyze patient information. Some vendors incorporate contract language whereby purchasers of HIT systems, such as hospitals and clinics, must indemnify vendors for malpractice or personal injury claims, even if those events are not caused or fostered by the purchasers. Some vendors require contract clauses that force HIT system purchasers to adopt vendor-defined policies that prevent the disclosure of errors, bugs, design flaws, and other HIT-software-related hazards. To address this issue, the AMIA Board of Directors appointed a Task Force to provide an analysis and insights. Task Force findings and recommendations include: patient safety should trump all other values; corporate concerns about liability and intellectual property ownership may be valid but should not over-ride all other considerations; transparency and a commitment to patient safety should govern vendor contracts; institutions are duty-bound to provide ethics education to purchasers and users, and should commit publicly to standards of corporate conduct; and vendors, system purchasers, and users should encourage and assist in each others' efforts to adopt best practices. Finally, the HIT community should re-examine whether and how regulation of electronic health applications could foster improved care, public health, and patient safety.},

The connectors for terms used in searches were studied, and observations were made of 9 users' search behavior when working with the TRIP database., Results: Of 620,735 searches, most used a single term, and 12\% (n = 75,947) used a Boolean operator: 11\% (n = 69,006) used “AND” and 0.8\% (n = 4,941) used “OR.” Of the elements of a well-structured clinical question (population, intervention, comparator, and outcome), the population was most commonly used, while fewer searches included the intervention. Comparator and outcome were rarely used. Participants in the observational study were interested in learning how to formulate better searches., Conclusions: Web log analysis showed most searches used a single term and no Boolean operators. Observational study revealed users were interested in conducting efficient searches but did not always know how. Therefore, either better training or better search interfaces are required to assist users and enable more effective searching.},

The process the nurse must follow includes preparing, checking, and administering medications; updating knowledge of medications; monitoring the effectiveness of treatment; reporting adverse reactions; and teaching patients about their drugs.
PROCESSES FOR MEDICATION MANAGEMENT IN HOME HEALTH CARE: The steps that home health nurses (HHNs) go through with families and the system changes that could be developed to decrease errors were identified. The approach was based on Failure Mode and Effects Analysis-a method to identify and prevent process problems before they occur. The medication management process was divided into drug utilization review (DUR) for duplicative and harmful interactions; drug administration by the patient, family member, and/or caregiver; and side effects. Failure modes were developed for a DUR for duplicative and harmful interactions.
DISCUSSION: Home health agencies should analyze the medication management process in their own agencies and identify system solutions. The difficulty encountered by HHNs in contacting physicians to discuss changes to the drug regimen following the assessment of potential drug interactions or duplications is an ongoing problem. Careful monitoring by HHNs could decrease the impact of adverse drug effects.},

	abstract = {Aim: To explore patients' and family members' perspectives on how safety threats are detected and managed across care transitions and strategies that improve care transitions from acute care hospitals to complex continuing care and rehabilitation health care organizations. Background: Poorly executed care transitions can result in additional health care spending due to adverse outcomes and delays as patients wait to transfer from acute care to facilities providing different levels of care. Patients and their families play an integral role in ensuring they receive safe care, as they are the one constant in care transitions processes. However, patients' and family members' perspectives on how safety threats are detected and managed across care transitions from health care facility to health care facility remain poorly understood. Methods: This qualitative study used semistructured interviews with patients (15) and family members (seven) who were transferred from an acute care hospital to a complex continuing care/rehabilitation care facility. Data were analyzed using a directed content analytical approach. Results: Our results revealed three key overarching themes in the perceptions: lacking information, getting "funneled through" too soon, and difficulty adjusting to the shift from total care to almost self-care. Several patients and families described their expectations and experiences associated with their interfacility care transitions as being uninformed about their transfer or that transfer happened too early. In addition, study participants identified the need for having a coordinated approach to care transitions that engages patients and family members. Conclusion: Study findings provide patients' and family members' perspectives on key safety threats and how to improve care transitions.

The physical environment, family dynamics and the cognitive abilities of the client and family members are only a few of the factors to be considered in delivering services. Although targeted initiatives have been established to reduce preventable injuries and deaths in the hospital sector, there has not been a corresponding level of research or patient safety initiatives in other healthcare delivery sectors. A coordinated and collaborative approach to generate new knowledge pertaining to safety in home care in Canada has therefore been undertaken by the Canadian Patient Safety Institute (CPSI), VON Canada, and Capital Health (Edmonton). Actions included the development of a background paper (Lang and Edwards 2006) that informed an invitational roundtable discussion, where key safety issues in home care were identified and priority actions discussed. Over 40 individuals from across Canada participated, reflecting various disciplinary and organizational affiliations in the delivery of home care services. This paper describes key findings from the background paper, outcomes from the ensuing roundtable discussions and implications for practice, research and policy.},

	abstract = {Purpose: As a highly heterogeneous group, seniors live in complex environments influenced by multiple physical and social structures that affect their safety. Until now, the major approach to falls research has been person centered. However, in industrial settings, the individuals involved in an accident are seen as the inheritors of system defects. The objective of the present study was to investigate safety deficiencies that contributed to falls in community-dwelling seniors using a systems approach. Design and Methods: The investigations were conducted using the Seniors Falls Investigation Methodology (SFIM), an adapted version of a method used to examine transportation accidents, such as airplane crashes. Fifteen seniors, who experienced a fall or near fall, participated in multiple case studies. A cross-case synthesis was used to summarize findings and identify common patterns of causes and safety deficiencies. Results: Falls and near falls are a result of latent unsafe conditions, and unsafe acts and decisions combined in a diverse set of circumstances. If not identified and removed, these unsafe conditions can cause falls for other seniors. Implications: This study provided compelling evidence that causes of falling are systemic and develop over time. It demonstrated that the systems approach is needed to expand the focus from the individual to multilayered organizational and supervisory causes. The SFIM demonstrated capability to identify causes of falls that will allow better prevention and management programs, hence advancing seniors’ safety. SFIM shows great potential for implementation in organized settings, such as hospitals and long-term care homes.},

	abstract = {Objectives The objectives of this study were to document the incidence rate and types of adverse events (AEs) among home care (HC) clients in Canada; identify factors contributing to these AEs; and determine to what extent evidence of completion of incident reports were documented in charts where AEs were found.
Methods This was a retrospective cohort study based on expert chart review of a random sample of 1200 charts of clients discharged in fiscal year 2009–2010 from publicly funded HC programmes in Manitoba, Quebec and Nova Scotia, Canada.
Results The results show that 4.2\% (95\% CI 3.0\% to 5.4\%) of HC patients discharged in a 12-month period experienced an AE. Adjusting to account for clients with lengths of stay in HC of less than 1 year, the AE incidence rate per client-year was 10.1\% (95\% CI 8.4\% to 11.8\%); 56\% of AEs were judged preventable. The most frequent AEs were injuries from falls, wound infections, psychosocial, behavioural or mental health problems and adverse outcomes from medication errors. More comorbid conditions (OR 1.15; 95\% CI 1.05 to 1.26) and a lower instrumental activities of daily living score (OR 1.54; 95\% CI 1.16 to 2.04) were associated with a higher risk of experiencing an AE. Clients’ decisions or actions contributed to 48.4\% of AEs, informal caregivers 20.4\% of AEs, and healthcare personnel 46.2\% of AEs. Only 17.3\% of charts with an AE contained documentation that indicated an incident report was completed, while 4.8\% of charts without an AE had such documentation.
Conclusions Client safety is an important issue in HC, as it is in institutionalised care. HC includes the planned delivery of self-care by clients and care provision by family, friends and other individuals often described as ‘informal’ caregivers. As clients and these caregivers can contribute to the occurrence of AEs, their involvement in the delivery of healthcare interventions at home must be considered when planning strategies to improve HC safety.},

	abstract = {Aims and objectives

To investigate the experiences of home care nurses with electronic messaging (e-messaging) and to determine how it influenced their communication with general practitioners.


Background

Nurses in home care services must collaborate with general practitioners to care for homebound patients. Studies have shown that communication and collaboration are often constrained because they are organised separately and are dispersed. The use of information and communication technology is expected to support communication and to be a tool for increased patient safety and higher-quality care.


Design

Cross-sectional study with group comparisons


Methods

The data were collected with a mailed questionnaire that was answered by home care nurses (n = 425) who had implemented e-messaging and by home care nurses in a comparison group who had not implemented e-messaging (n = 364). The data were analysed using descriptive analyses, chi-square test, Mann–Whitney U-test and multilevel analysis.


Results

The home care nurses who used e-messages reported to a greater extent that they had communication procedures with general practitioners compared to what the home care nurses in the comparison group reported. The implementation of e-messaging did not result in timelier communication or differences between the two groups in the use of nonelectronic communication, except for a lower use of faxes in the e-messaging group. However, the home care nurses who used e-messaging reported more frequent contacts with general practitioners.


Conclusion

The results demonstrate that even if e-messaging was implemented, the home care nurses and the general practitioners continued to use nonelectronic communication methods.


Relevance to clinical practice

E-messaging did not replace but rather complemented the communication methods and thereby transformed clinical communication and collaboration. This should be considered when planning and implementing new information technology in primary care.},

Thus, the objectives of this qualitative study were to describe the safety challenges of home care triads and to further understand the multiple dimensions of safety that contribute to or reduce safety concerns for these triads. Findings indicate that clients, unpaid caregivers, and providers struggle in the home care system.

	abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to explore and compare hospital and home care nurses’ assessment of their information management at patients’ discharge from hospital to home care before and after the hospital implemented an electronic nursing discharge note.

Theory
This paper draws on the concept of inter-organizational continuity of care, and specifically addresses the contribution of the implementation of an electronic patient record (EPR).

Methods
The study has a prospective descriptive design. A questionnaire addressing the information that hospital and home care nurses exchange when patients need continuing care after hospitalization was developed and used.

Results
Hospital and home care nurses differed in the way they assessed the structures and content of the information they exchanged, both before and after the EPR implementation.

Conclusion and discussion
There is a need to take account of the different organizational contexts within which the two nursing groups work. The organizational context (hospital versus home care) has implications for the nurses’ assessment of the information they exchange. In further development of EPR, it is therefore essential to clarify the context-related information needs of the various health care provider groups as part of the commitment to patient safety.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Home health care is the delivery of predominantly medically related services to patients in a home setting rather than in a medical facility. It provides substantial benefits over traditional, hospital-based health care, such as supporting older adults’ independence and quality of life, as well as being more cost-effective. This aspect of the health care industry could be enhanced through increased technological supports. When providing health care in a home setting, formal caregivers, such as certified nursing assistants (CNAs), registered nurses (RNs), physical therapists (PTs), and occupational therapists (OTs), are faced with many challenges that impede their ability to perform their jobs. Technological interventions have the potential to alleviate many of these challenges. However, to achieve this potential, new technologies must be created to meet the needs of home health care providers. To date, these providers’ specific and most critical needs are not thoroughly understood. This understanding can be gained by conducting a detailed needs assessment that captures the common challenges and difficulties that home health care providers encounter. We conducted a needs assessment comprising three phases: (a) an extensive literature review of research regarding the needs of home health providers, both hospital and home-based (CNAs, RNs, PTs, and OTs); (b) subject matter expert interviews with experienced individuals from home health care; and (c) structured interviews with CNAs. We identified several significant sources of frustration and difficulty faced by CNAs including medical device usage, patient education, family involvement, provider isolation, and barriers to communication. This analysis provides an understanding of the challenges confronting home health care providers that can provide guidance for interventions. Future home health care technology can be developed to specifically target these workers’ most urgent needs and allow them to perform their jobs with greater ease. Moreover, RNs, PTs, and OTs can benefit from understanding some of the challenges faced by their teammates in the home health care process.},

This manuscript introduces an 8-dimensional model specifically designed to address the socio-technical challenges involved in design, development, implementation, use, and evaluation of HIT within complex adaptive healthcare systems. The 8 dimensions are not independent, sequential, or hierarchical, but rather are interdependent and interrelated concepts similar to compositions of other complex adaptive systems. Hardware and software computing infrastructure refers to equipment and software used to power, support, and operate clinical applications and devices. Clinical content refers to textual or numeric data and images that constitute the “language” of clinical applications. The human computer interface includes all aspects of the computer that users can see, touch, or hear as they interact with it. People refers to everyone who interacts in some way with the system, from developer to end-user, including potential patient-users. Workflow and communication are the processes or steps involved in assuring that patient care tasks are carried out effectively. Two additional dimensions of the model are internal organizational features (e.g., policies, procedures, and culture) and external rules and regulations, both of which may facilitate or constrain many aspects of the preceding dimensions. The final dimension is measurement and monitoring, which refers to the process of measuring and evaluating both intended and unintended consequences of HIT implementation and use. We illustrate how our model has been successfully applied in real-world complex adaptive settings to understand and improve HIT applications at various stages of development and implementation.},

	abstract = {In the United States, health care devices, technologies, and practices are rapidly moving into the home. The factors driving this migration include the costs of health care, the growing numbers of older adults, the increasing prevalence of chronic conditions and diseases and improved survival rates for people with those conditions and diseases, and a wide range of technological innovations. The health care that results varies considerably in its safety, effectiveness, and efficiency, as well as in its quality and cost.    Health Care Comes Home reviews the state of current knowledge and practice about many aspects of health care in residential settings and explores the short- and long-term effects of emerging trends and technologies.   By evaluating existing systems, the book identifies design problems and imbalances between technological system demands and the capabilities of users.  Health Care Comes Home recommends critical steps to improve health care in the home. The book's recommendations cover the regulation of health care technologies, proper training and preparation for people who provide in-home care, and how existing housing can be modified and new accessible housing can be better designed for residential health care. The book also identifies knowledge gaps in the field and how these can be addressed through research and development initiatives.   Health Care Comes Home lays the foundation for the integration of human health factors with the design and implementation of home health care devices, technologies, and practices.  The book describes ways in which the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and federal housing agencies can collaborate to improve the quality of health care at home.  It is also a valuable resource for residential health care providers and caregivers.},

Three families with young children received an augmented version of the Safety module of SafeCare, a home-visiting child maltreatment prevention program. Specifically, parents were trained to use an iPhone to video rooms in their homes, as well as communicate feedback, logistics, and safety content between the home visitor and parent. The effectiveness of iPhone and video was examined using a multiple baseline design across in-home settings replicated across families. Home hazards were reduced dramatically across rooms and across participants. Face-to-face time of the home visitor was progressively reduced and replaced by video data collection. These data suggest smartphones are promising for data collection and for augmenting face-to-face interactions. Implications for reducing costs as smartphones become increasingly ubiquitous and for engaging and retaining participants are discussed.},

Older adults completing HSOA are screened and educated regarding fall risk, and those identified as being at high risk are referred to primary care providers and home safety resources. Methods. From 2010 to 2011, older adults who completed HSOA at various senior center sites (n = 814) and a comparison group of older adults from the same sites who did not complete the program (n = 1019) were recruited and followed monthly. Although participants were not randomly allocated to study conditions, the 2 groups did not differ in fall risk at baseline or attrition. We used a telephone interactive voice response system to ascertain the number of falls that occurred each month. Results. In multivariate models, adjusted fall incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were lower in the HSOA group than in the comparison group for both total (IRR = 0.83; 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.72, 0.96) and activity-adjusted (IRR = 0.81; 95\% CI = 0.70, 0.93) months of follow-up. Conclusions. Use of existing aging services in primary prevention of falls is feasible, resulting in a 17\% reduction in our sample in the rate of falls over the follow-up period.},

Methods: Analysis of injury data, extensive direct observation and analysis of aide-patient interactions, participatory intervention ideation focus group discussions, and intervention pilot testing was conducted. Results: A method of categorizing each patient’s level of skill in transfer and bathing activities, and their mobility assistance requirements was developed from information collected during the study as well as a review of the literature. In a pilot test, the new categorization scheme was used to control the aides’ daily exposure to higher needs patients. The percentage of time that aides worked with patients in higher needs categories was found to be related to the aides’ self-reports of end-of-shift fatigue and pain.Conclusion: Home health care companies may find that developing a scheduling system that manages the exposure of their aides to higher needs patients may be a feasible and effective method for reducing the aides’ exposure to risk factors for musculoskeletal injuries.

Furthermore, it is unclear how training for telecare users has addressed patient safety issues. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to identify patient safety risks associated with telecare use in homecare services and to investigate whether and how these patient safety risks have been addressed in telecare training. Methods Six electronic databases were searched in addition to hand searches of key items, reference tracking and citation tracking. Strict inclusion and exclusion criteria were set. All included items were assessed according to set quality criteria and subjected to a narrative synthesis to organise and synthesize the findings. A human factors systems framework of patient safety was used to frame and analyse the results. Results 22 items were included in the review. 11 types of patient safety risks associated with telecare use in homecare services emerged. These are in the main related to the nature of homecare tasks and practices, and person-centred characteristics and capabilities, and to a lesser extent, problems with the technology and devices, organisational issues, and environmental factors. Training initiatives related to safe telecare use are not described in the literature. Conclusions There is a need to better identify and describe patient safety risks related to telecare services to improve understandings of how to avoid and minimize potential harm to patients. This process can be aided by reframing known telecare implementation challenges and user experiences of telecare with the help of a human factors systems approach to patient safety.},

	abstract = {Background Patient safety and adverse events in primary care are receiving increasing attention from policy makers, professional bodies and researchers. Various taxonomic models have been developed to specify the factors that predispose to adverse events in hospital settings. These are assumed to have general applicability across different healthcare settings. However, they have never been applied to home health care. Aims This study helps define the value of one such model in a domiciliary setting. The principal purpose of the study was to understand the circumstances in which the involvement of local authorityfunded home carers as well as NHS-funded district nurses in medication-related activities for older people living at home in the UK might jeopardise patient safety. Method The study was undertaken in two contrasting sites. One was in London and the other in the Midlands. District nurses and home carers were purposively selected to take part in semi-structured interviews. The data were used to construct a taxonomic model that specified the factors that predispose older people to adverse events when medication-related responsibilities are transferred from district nursing to home care services. Results The new taxonomy was compared to the taxonomic model under investigation. Dissonance existed within a number of categories. Conclusions The model under investigation was found to be too narrow for application in domiciliary settings. The challenges that exist in home health care are often very different from those that exist in hospital settings, from which the model under investigation was derived. The root causes of accidents are most likely to be identified by models empirically derived from, and tailored to fit, the particular circumstances in which they are to be applied.},

In this study, we showed that home care nurses felt that healthcare personnel were more concerned with the treatment of falls, rather than fall prevention. In addition, home care nurses rarely focused on falls before they occurred. The patient's autonomy was placed before patient safety. This study illustrates that home care nurses might be more aware of fall prevention in clinical practice. Additional research is recommended to shed more light on this topic.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Home health care is the fastest growing sector in the health care industry, with an anticipated growth of 66 percent over the next 10 years and with over 7 million patients served each year. With the increasing acuteness of care provided in home health care and the increasing number of frail elderly that make up this patient population, it is important to identify risk factors that affect patient health and safety in this setting. Methods: A convenience sample of 1,561 home health aides, attendants, and personal care workers completed a risk assessment survey. Items addressed personal, patient, and home characteristics and health hazards. All activities had prior Institutional Review Board approval. Preliminary Results: Ninety-five percent of home health care workers (HHCWs) were female with an average of 8 years experience. The majority of clients were elderly, with a smaller percentage of adult (26 percent) and pediatric (7 percent) cases. HHCWs reported the following exposures at their clients’ homes: cockroaches (33 percent), cigarette smoke (30 percent), vermin (23 percent), irritating chemicals (17 percent), and peeling paint (15 percent). The following conditions were also described: clutter (17 percent), temperature extremes (9 percent), unsanitary (12 percent) and unsafe (6 percent) conditions in the home, neighborhood violence/crime (11 percent), and aggressive pets (6 percent). Two percent of respondents reported the presence of guns in the home. Additionally, 12 percent of HHCWs reported signs of abuse of their clients. Conclusion: Both HHCWs and home care patients appear to be at potential risk due to a variety of health hazards/exposures in the clients’ homes. Given the growing population of both HHCWs and recipients, it is important to document this risk as an important first step in prevention and management.},

	abstract = {Home health care clinicians seek to provide high quality, safe care in ways that honor patient autonomy and accommodate the individual characteristics of each patient’s home and family. Falls, declining functional abilities, pressure ulcers and nonhealing wounds, and adverse events related to medication administration all have the potential to result in unplanned hospital admissions. Such hospitalizations undermine the achievement of important home health care goals: keeping patients at home and promoting optimal well-being. Nevertheless, the unique characteristics of home health care may make it difficult to use—or necessary to alter—interventions that have been shown to be effective in other settings. Therefore, research on effective practices, conducted in home health care settings, is necessary to support excellent and evidence-based care. In reviewing the extant studies, the authors of this chapter found useful evidence in all selected areas. However, the number of studies was few and many questions remain. Replications of investigations originally conducted in health care settings other than the home, and studies considering home health care-specific issues are needed to support evidence-based clinical decisions. The available evidence suggests that the work environment in which home health care nurses practice may indirectly influence patient outcomes in many areas, and that technology can be used to support positive patient outcomes. Thus, studies that link nurse-related variables to improved care safety and quality are needed, as well as studies that focus directly on patients. The demographics of an aging society will sustain the trend toward home-based care. Home health care practices grounded in careful research will sustain the patients and the clinicians who serve them. Given the focused review of evidence-based studies comprising this chapter, many informative sources of use to the practicing home health care nurse are omitted. Table 8 lists additional key resources.},

This paper reviews the application of one such theory, the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), to health care. We reviewed 16 data sets analyzed in over 20 studies of clinicians using health IT for patient care. Studies differed greatly in samples and settings, health ITs studied, research models, relationships tested, and construct operationalization. Certain TAM relationships were consistently found to be significant, whereas others were inconsistent. Several key relationships were infrequently assessed. Findings show that TAM predicts a substantial portion of the use or acceptance of health IT, but that the theory may benefit from several additions and modifications. Aside from improved study quality, standardization, and theoretically motivated additions to the model, an important future direction for TAM is to adapt the model specifically to the health care context, using beliefs elicitation methods.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Health information exchange (HIE), the process of electronically moving patient-level information between different organizations, is viewed as a solution to the fragmentation of data in health care. This review provides a description of the current state of HIE in seven nations, as well was three international HIE efforts, with a particular focus on the relation of exchange efforts to national health care systems, common challenges, and the implications of cross-border information sharing. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: National and international efforts highlighted in English language informatics journals, professional associations, and government reports are described. FINDINGS: Fully functioning HIE is not yet a common phenomenon worldwide. However, multiple nations see the potential benefits of HIE and that has led to national and international efforts of varying scope, scale, and purview. National efforts continue to work to overcome the challenges of interoperability, record linking, insufficient infrastructures, governance, and interorganizational relationships, but have created architectural strategies, oversight agencies, and incentives to foster exchange. The three international HIE efforts reviewed represent very different approaches to the same problem of ensuring the availability of health information across borders. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: The potential of HIE to address many cost and quality issues will ensure HIE remains on many national agendas. In many instances, health care executives and leaders have opportunities to work within national programs to help shape local exchange governance and decide technology partners. Furthermore, HIE raises policy questions concerning the role of centralized planning, national identifiers, standards, and types of information exchanged, each of which are vital issues to individual health organizations and worthy of their attention.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to find out how many health information exchanges (HIEs) are using metrics to gauge their impact and to gather examples of metrics being used by HIEs. We administered a web-based survey to a list of functioning HIEs. Valid responses were received from 18 HIEs. Most respondents were nonprofits, most had sustainable business models, and half used metrics to gauge their impact. Reduction of duplicative testing, quality improvement efforts, care coordination, and improved readmission rates were cited as having the greatest potential to show return on investment. Most respondents selected patient-centered care as having the greatest potential to show quality improvement. The major limitation of this study is the low response rate. This study suggests that there are no standard metrics used by HIEs to evaluate their impact. The HIE community needs to take the lead in developing metrics to evaluate the benefits of information exchange.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to describe how comprehensive HIV care is delivered within Ryan White Program (RWP)-funded clinics and to characterize proposed health information exchange (HIE) interventions, which employ technology to exchange information among providers, designed to improve the quality and coordination of clinical and support services. METHODS: We use HIV patient care quality and coordination indicators from electronic data systems to describe care delivery in six RWP demonstration sites and describe HIE interventions designed to enhance that care. RESULTS: Among patients currently in care, 91\% were retained in care in the previous six months (range across sites: 63-99\%), 79\% were appropriately prescribed antiretroviral therapy (54-91\%) and 52\% had achieved undetectable HIV viral load (16-85\%). To facilitate coordination of care across clinical and support services, sites designed HIE interventions to access a variety of data systems (e.g. surveillance, electronic health records, laboratory and billing) and focused on improving linkage and retention, quality and efficiency of care and increased access to patient information. DISCUSSION: Care quality in RWP settings can be improved with HIE tools facilitating linkage, retention and coordination of care. When fully leveraged, HIE interventions have the potential to improve coordination of care and thereby enhance patient health outcomes.},

A two-year analysis, involving more than 600 patients, found nearly four times fewer severe psychiatric relapses requiring readmission among patients triaged by the crisis intervention service, compared to patients hospitalized without going through its service. The service saved approximately 3,347 days of hospital-based psychiatric care over the two-year study period. This program evaluation data, combined with previous research, documents that for the vast majority of hospitalized psychiatric patients, intensive in-home crisis intervention and treatment services are a more effective and cost-efficient form of care.},

	title = {Is home health care a substitute for hospital care?},
	volume = {31},
	doi = {10.1080/01621424.2011.644497},
	abstract = {A previous study used aggregate (region-level) data to investigate whether home health care serves as a substitute for inpatient hospital care and concluded that "there is no evidence that services provided at home replace hospital services." However, that study was based on a cross-section of regions observed at a single point of time and did not control for unobserved regional heterogeneity. In this article, state-level employment data are used to reexamine whether home health care serves as a substitute for inpatient hospital care. This analysis is based on longitudinal (panel) data–observations on states in two time periods–which enable the reduction or elimination of biases that arise from use of cross-sectional data. This study finds that states that had higher home health care employment growth during the period 1998-2008 tended to have lower hospital employment growth, controlling for changes in population. Moreover, states that had higher home health care payroll growth tended to have lower hospital payroll growth. The estimates indicate that the reduction in hospital payroll associated with a \$1,000 increase in home health payroll is not less than \$1,542, and may be as high as \$2,315. This study does not find a significant relationship between growth in utilization of home health care and growth in utilization of nursing and residential care facilities. An important reason why home health care may serve as a substitute for hospital care is that the availability of home health care may allow patients to be discharged from the hospital earlier. Hospital discharge data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project are used to test the hypothesis that use of home health care reduces the length of hospital stays. Major Diagnostic Categories with larger increases in the fraction of patients discharged to home health care tended to have larger declines in mean length of stay (LOS). Between 1998 and 2008, mean LOS declined by 4.1\%, from 4.78 to 4.59 days. The estimates are consistent with the hypothesis that this was entirely due to the increase in the fraction of hospital patients discharged to home health care, from 6.4\% in 1998 to 9.9\% in 2008. The estimated reduction in 2008 hospital costs resulting from the rise in the fraction of hospital patients discharged to home health care may have been 36\% larger than the increase in the payroll of the home health care industry.},

To learn from the experiences of providers that have widely incorporated electronic communication into patient care, we interviewed leaders of twenty-one medical groups that use it extensively with patients. We also interviewed staff in six of those groups. Electronic communication was widely perceived to be a safe, effective, and efficient means of communication that improves patient satisfaction and saves patients time but that increases the volume of physician work unless office visits are reduced. Practice redesign and new payment methods are likely necessary for electronic communication to be more widely used in patient care.},

	abstract = {Hospices have been expected to reduce health expenditures since their addition to the US Medicare benefit package in the early-1980s, but the literature on their ability to do so is mixed. The contradictory findings noted in previous studies may be due to selection bias and the period of cost comparison used. Accounting for these, this study focuses on the length of hospice use that maximizes reductions in medical expenditures near death. We used a retrospective, case/control study of Medicare decedents (1993–2003, National Long Term Care Survey screening sample) to compare 1819 hospice decedents, with 3638 controls matched via their predicted likelihood of dying while using a hospice. Variables used to create matches were demographic, primary medical condition, cost of Medicare financed care prior to the last year of life, nursing home residence and Medicaid eligibility. Hospice use reduced Medicare program expenditures during the last year of life by an average of \$2309 per hospice user; expenditures after initiation of hospice were \$7318 for hospice users compared to \$9627 for controls (P{\textbackslash}textless0.001). On average, hospice use reduced Medicare expenditures during all but 2 of hospice users’ last 72 days of life; about \$10 on the 72nd day prior to death, with savings increasing to more than \$750 on the day of death. Maximum cumulative expenditure reductions differed by primary condition. The maximum reduction in Medicare expenditures per user was about \$7000, which occurred when a decedent had a primary condition of cancer and used a hospice for their last 58–103 days of life. For other primary conditions, the maximum savings of around \$3500 occurred when a hospice was used for the last 50–108 days of life. Given the length of hospice use observed in the Medicare program, increasing the length of hospice use for 7 in 10 Medicare hospice users would increase savings.},

DATA SOURCES: The Research and Development Resource Base in Continuing Medical Education, maintained by the University of Toronto, was searched, as was MEDLINE from January 1990 to June 1996, inclusive, with the use of the MeSH heading "practice guidelines" and relevant text words. STUDY SELECTION: Studies of CPG implementation strategies and reviews of such studies were selected. Randomized controlled trials and trials that objectively measured physicians' performance or health care outcomes were emphasized. DATA EXTRACTION: Articles were reviewed to determine the effect of various factors on the adoption of guidelines. DATA SYNTHESIS: The articles showed that CPG dissemination or implementation processes have mixed results. Variables that affect the adoption of guidelines include qualities of the guidelines, characteristics of the health care professional, characteristics of the practice setting, incentives, regulation and patient factors. Specific strategies fell into 2 categories: primary strategies involving mailing or publication of the actual guidelines and secondary interventional strategies to reinforce the guidelines. The interventions were shown to be weak (didactic, traditional continuing medical education and mailings), moderately effective (audit and feedback, especially concurrent, targeted to specific providers and delivered by peers or opinion leaders) and relatively strong (reminder systems, academic detailing and multiple interventions). CONCLUSIONS: The evidence shows serious deficiencies in the adoption of CPGs in practice. Future implementation strategies must overcome this failure through an understanding of the forces and variables influencing practice and through the use of methods that are practice- and community-based rather than didactic.},

The authors used logistic regression to study the effects of telehomecare on health services utilization and mortality and a general linear model to analyze changes in self-reported symptoms. On average, patients in the telehomecare groups had a lower probability of hospitalizations and ED visits than did patients in the control group. Differences were statistically significant at 60 days but not 120 days. Results show a greater reduction in symptoms for patients using telehomecare compared to control patients. The technology enables frequent monitoring of clinical indices and permits the home health care nurse to detect changes in cardiac status and intervene when necessary.},

The authors argue that the concept of “integrated patient care” would benefit from further clarification regarding (a) the object of integration and (b) its essential components, particularly when constructing measures.To address these issues, the authors propose a definition of integrated patient care that distinguishes it from integrated delivery organizations, acknowledging that integrated organizational structures and processes may fail to produce integrated patient care. The definition emphasizes patients’ central role as active participants in managing their own health by including patient centeredness as a key element of integrated patient care. Measures based on the proposed definition will enable empirical assessment of the potential relationships between the integration of organizations, the integration of patient care, and patient outcomes, providing valuable guidance to health systems reformers.},

	abstract = {BackgroundBackground Shared decision making (SDM) is a process by which a healthcare choice is made jointly by the practitioner and the patient and is said to be the crux of patient-centred care. Policy makers perceive SDM as desirable because of its potential to a) reduce overuse of options not clearly associated with benefits for all (e.g., prostate cancer screening); b) enhance the use of options clearly associated with benefits for the vast majority (e.g., cardiovascular risk factor management); c) reduce unwarranted healthcare practice variations; d) foster the sustainability of the healthcare system; and e) promote the right of patients to be involved in decisions concerning their health. Despite this potential, SDM has not yet been widely adopted in clinical practice. ObjectivesObjectives To determine the effectiveness of interventions to improve healthcare professionals’ adoption of SDM. Search methodsSearch methods We searched the following electronic databases up to 18 March 2009: Cochrane Library (1970-), MEDLINE (1966-), EMBASE (1976-), CINAHL (1982-) and PsycINFO (1965-). We found additional studies by reviewing a) the bibliographies of studies and reviews found in the electronic databases; b) the clinicaltrials.gov registry; and c) proceedings of the International Shared Decision Making Conference and the conferences of the Society for Medical Decision Making. We included all languages of publication. Selection criteriaSelection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or well-designed quasi-experimental studies (controlled clinical trials, controlled before and after studies, and interrupted time series analyses) that evaluated any type of intervention that aimed to improve healthcare professionals' adoption of shared decision making. We defined adoption as the extent to which healthcare professionals intended to or actually engaged in SDM in clinical practice or/and used interventions known to facilitate SDM. We deemed studies eligible if the primary outcomes were evaluated with an objective measure of the adoption of SDM by healthcare professionals (e.g., a third-observer instrument). Data collection and analysisData collection and analysis At least two reviewers independently screened each abstract for inclusion and abstracted data independently using a modified version of the EPOC data collection checklist. We resolved disagreements by discussion. Statistical analysis considered categorical and continuous primary outcomes. We computed the standard effect size for each outcome separately with a 95\% confidence interval. We evaluated global effects by calculating the median effect size and the range of effect sizes across studies. Main resultsMain results The reviewers identified 6764 potentially relevant documents, of which we excluded 6582 by reviewing titles and abstracts. Of the remainder, we retrieved 182 full publications for more detailed screening. From these, we excluded 176 publications based on our inclusion criteria. This left in five studies, all RCTs. All five were conducted in ambulatory care: three in primary clinical care and two in specialised care. Four of the studies targeted physicians only and one targeted nurses only. In only two of the five RCTs was a statistically significant effect size associated with the intervention to have healthcare professionals adopt SDM. The first of these two studies compared a single intervention (a patient-mediated intervention: the Statin Choice decision aid) to another single intervention (also patient-mediated: a standard Mayo patient education pamphlet). In this study, the Statin Choice decision aid group performed better than the standard Mayo patient education pamphlet group (standard effect size = 1.06; 95\% CI = 0.62 to 1.50). The other study compared a multifaceted intervention (distribution of educational material, educational meeting and audit and feedback) to usual care (control group) (standard effect size = 2.11; 95\% CI = 1.30 to 2.90). This study was the only one to report an assessment of barriers prior to the elaboration of its multifaceted intervention. Authors' conclusionsAuthors' conclusions The results of this Cochrane review do not allow us to draw firm conclusions about the most effective types of intervention for increasing healthcare professionals' adoption of SDM. Healthcare professional training may be important, as may the implementation of patient-mediated interventions such as decision aids. Given the paucity of evidence, however, those motivated by the ethical impetus to increase SDM in clinical practice will need to weigh the costs and potential benefits of interventions. Subsequent research should involve well-designed studies with adequate power and procedures to minimise bias so that they may improve estimates of the effects of interventions on healthcare professionals' adoption of SDM. From a measurement perspective, consensus on how to assess professionals' adoption of SDM is desirable to facilitate cross-study comparisons.},

	abstract = {Context Electronic medical records (EMRs) are increasingly viewed as essential tools for quality assurance and improvement in many care settings, but little is known about the use of EMRs by hospices in their quality assessment and performance improvement (QAPI) programs. Objectives To examine the data sources hospices use to create quality indicators (QIs) used in their QAPI programs and to examine the domains of EMR-based QIs. Methods We used self-reported QIs (description, numerator, and denominator) from 911 hospices nationwide that participated in the Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services nationwide hospice voluntary reporting period. The data reflected QIs that hospices used for their internal QAPI programs between October 1 and December 31, 2011. We used the primary data sources for QIs reported by hospices and analyzed EMR-based QIs in terms of the quality domains and themes addressed. Results EMRs were the most frequent data source for the QIs reported, followed by family survey and paper medical record. Physical symptom management was the largest quality domain—included in 51.5\% of the reported EMR-based QIs—followed by patient safety and structure and process of care. Conclusion Most participating hospices use EMRs for retrieving items needed for QI calculations. EMR-based QIs address various quality domains and themes. Our findings present opportunities for potential future reporting of EMR-based quality data.},

New technology, however, promises to enable a transformation in the delivery of care, putting patients at the center of care systems that engage and empower them and their families, directly connecting patients to care-givers, and personalizing services in response to patients’ unique needs, preferences, and values. Such care systems also offer the promise of strengthening an understaffed, underresourced home health care industry. Leveraging technology, disease management (DM), and home health have the opportunity to work together to more efficiently and effectively meet the needs of a rapidly aging society through better coordinated care that reduces avoidable hospital readmissions and other adverse events.

Design Nationally representative, cross-sectional survey of US HHH agencies conducted in 2007. Measurements Data on agency characteristics, current use of EMR systems as well as use of telemedicine and PoCD were collected. Results In 2007, 43\% of US HHH agencies reported use of an EMR system. Patient demographics (40\%) and clinical notes (34\%) were the most commonly used EMR functions among US HHH agencies. Only 20\% of agencies with EMR systems had health information sharing functionality and about half of them used it. Telemedicine was used by 21\% of all HHH agencies, with most (87\%) of these offering home health services. Among home health agencies using telemedicine, greater than 90\% used telephone monitoring and about two-thirds used non-video monitoring. Nearly 29\% of HHH agencies reported using electronic PoCD systems, most often for Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) data capture (79\%). Relative to for-profit HHH agencies, non-profit agencies used considerably more EMR (70\% vs 28\%, p{\textbackslash}textless0.001) and PoCD (63\% vs 9\%, p{\textbackslash}textless0.001). Conclusions Between 2000 and 2007, there was a 33\% increase in use of EMR among HHH agencies in the US. In 2007, use of EMR and PoCD technologies in non-profit agencies was significantly higher than for-profit ones. Finally, HHH agencies generally tended to use available EMR functionalities, including health information sharing.},

	abstract = {EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In an effort to better understand the current use and adoption rates of electronic health records and other health information technology (HIT) applications within nursing homes, the Division of Health Care Policy and Research at the University of Colorado Denver has been contracted by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop survey instruments for use in long-term care provider settings. Although numerous survey instruments have been fielded to assess HIT use in nursing homes and long-term care settings, the lack of consistent definitions, terminology, item construction, sampling frames, and measurement criteria render it difficult to accurately gauge current HIT adoption. In this report, we review existing surveys for long-term care and other provider settings pertaining to current HIT use and adoption, barriers to adoption, and recommend issues to consider when developing survey questions to ascertain HIT adoption, use, and barriers to adoption and use in nursing homes. Section I of the deliverable discusses current trends and policy initiatives in HIT for long-term care. Section II summarizes several existing surveys on HIT use and adoption in long-term care settings, compares key findings of the surveys, and discusses measurement issues affecting survey results. Surveys used to assess HIT use and adoption in home health and hospice organizations, ambulatory or physician practices, and hospitals are discussed in Section III to determine if survey items and techniques from other settings could be used in long-term care. The descriptions of survey characteristics and findings were drawn from published papers or web-accessible information. The comparison of survey findings presented in Section II and Section III highlights the assertion that lack of consistency with regard to data items and measurement methods hinders efforts to draw meaningful conclusions from published survey results. Despite national support for widespread adoption of HIT across health care settings and growing recognition of its value in improving health care safety, quality, and efficiency, HIT adoption continues at a relatively slow pace. Recent efforts have been made to identify barriers contributing to the limited progress in HIT adoption and supply information to help guide the development of policies and incentives to promote more rapid HIT proliferation. In addition to the review of surveys on HIT adoption, we reviewed the literature on barriers to HIT adoption across provider settings. A brief synthesis of existing surveys and literature on barriers is found in Section IV. Section V provides recommendations for future survey development for long-term care. To reliably ascertain HIT adoption, use, and barriers in nursing homes, two sets of survey questions are recommended: (1) a shorter, core set of questions for possible use in the National Nursing Home Survey sponsored by the National Center for Health Statistics; and (2) an expanded set of questions, which would be made available to industry stakeholder groups for survey administration. The creation of two sets of survey questions will provide both breadth and depth in the collection of information on the adoption of HIT applications in nursing homes. The core set of questions would provide an overview of HIT adoption that could be generalized to the industry as a whole. The expanded, longer set of questions keyed off of the core set of questions would provide in-depth, detailed data on the extent to which specific workflow and health information exchange processes are being adopted. Both sets of questions will provide valuable information to policy makers to assess movement toward the goal of promoting HIT adoption and make informed decisions about the policy actions that are needed to accelerate adoption. Our recommendations on the content and format for the survey questions will guide the remainder of this project.},

Increasing availability of information can also facilitate organisational learning, which leads to the invocation of processes that result in improved responses and decisions. This study examined crucial links between HITs and quality of service provided through an empirical investigation of 252 patients in a hospital-in-the-home unit (HHU) in a Spanish regional hospital. The study sought to test the relationship between HITs and the quality of service using factor analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM) to investigate how HITs mediate effects of organisational learning on quality of service. Findings support the notion that the relationship between organisational learning and quality of service can be mediated by HITs. This study provides HHU managers with guidelines for understanding the role of organisational learning processes with respect toHITs and quality of service.},

	abstract = {Background Adolescents present many challenges in providing them effective preventive services and health care. Yet, they are typically the early adopters of new technology (eg, the Internet). This creates important opportunities for engaging youths via eHealth. Objective To describe how adolescents use technology for their health-information needs, identify the challenges they face, and highlight some emerging roles of health professionals regarding eHealth services for adolescents. Methods Using an inductive qualitative research design, 27 focus groups were conducted in Ontario, Canada. The 210 participants (55\% female, 45\% male; median age 16 years) were selected to reflect diversity in age, sex, geographic location, cultural identity, and risk. An 8-person team analyzed and coded the data according to major themes. Results Study participants most-frequently sought or distributed information related to school (89\%), interacting with friends (85\%), social concerns (85\%), specific medical conditions (67\%), body image and nutrition (63\%), violence and personal safety (59\%), and sexual health (56\%). Finding personally-relevant, high-quality information was a pivotal challenge that has ramifications on the depth and types of information that adolescents can find to answer their health questions. Privacy in accessing information technology was a second key challenge. Participants reported using technologies that clustered into 4 domains along a continuum from highly-interactive to fixed information sources: (1) personal communication: telephone, cell phone, and pager; (2) social communication: e-mail, instant messaging, chat, and bulletin boards; (3) interactive environments: Web sites, search engines, and computers; and (4) unidirectional sources: television, radio, and print. Three emerging roles for health professionals in eHealth include: (1) providing an interface for adolescents with technology and assisting them in finding pertinent information sources; (2) enhancing connection to youths by extending ways and times when practitioners are available; and (3) fostering critical appraisal skills among youths for evaluating the quality of health information. Conclusions This study helps illuminate adolescent health-information needs, their use of information technologies, and emerging roles for health professionals. The findings can inform the design and more-effective use of eHealth applications for adolescent populations.},

	abstract = {AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to describe the ability of an evidence-based discharge planning (DP) decision support tool to identify and prioritise patients appropriate for early DP intervention. Specifically, we aimed to determine whether patients with a high Early Screen for Discharge Planning (ESDP) score report more problems and continuing care needs in the first few weeks after discharge than patients with low ESDP scores.
BACKGROUND: Improved methods are needed to efficiently and accurately identify hospitalised patients at risk of complex discharge plans.
DESIGN: A descriptive cross-sectional study was designed using a quality health outcomes framework.
METHODS: The ESDP was administered to 260 adults hospitalised in an academic health centre who returned home after discharge. Problems and continuing care needs were self-reported on the Problems After Discharge Questionnaire - English Version, mailed 6-10 days after discharge.
RESULTS: Patients with high ESDP scores reported significantly more problems [mean, 16·3 (standard deviation ±8·7)] than those with low scores [12·2 (±8·4)]. Within the Problems After Discharge Questionnaire subscales, patients with high ESDP scores reported significantly more problems with personal care, household activities, mobility and physical difficulties than patients with low screen scores. Significantly more of the patients with a high ESDP score received consults to a Discharge Planner and referrals for postacute services than patients with low screen scores.
CONCLUSION: The ESDP is effective as a decision support tool in identifying patients to prioritise for early DP intervention.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Use of an evidence-based DP decision support tool minimises biases inherent in decision-making, promotes efficient use of hospital DP resources, and improves the opportunity for patients to access community resources they need to promote successful recovery after hospitalisation.},

	abstract = {Introduction. Information and communication technology (ICT) are becoming a natural part in healthcare both for delivering and giving accessibility to healthcare for people with chronic illness living at home. Aim. The aim was to review existing studies describing the use of ICT in home care for communication between patients, family members, and healthcare professionals. Methods. A review of studies was conducted that identified 1,276 studies. A selection process and quality appraisal were conducted, which finally resulted in 107 studies. Results. The general results offer an overview of characteristics of studies describing the use of ICT applications in home care and are summarized in areas including study approach, quality appraisal, publications data, terminology used for defining the technology, and disease diagnosis. The specific results describe how communication with ICT was performed in home care and the benefits and drawbacks with the use of ICT. Results were predominated by positive responses in the use of ICT. Conclusion. The use of ICT applications in home care is an expanding research area, with a variety of ICT tools used that could increase accessibility to home care. Using ICT can lead to people living with chronic illnesses gaining control of their illness that promotes self-care.},

They shared their perceptions of the work they needed to do and their perceptions and expectations for patients and themselves in using technologies to promote and manage self-care. We document three overarching themes that identify preexisting factors that influenced integration or represent the consequences of technology integration into home care: doing tasks differently, making accommodations in the home for devices and computers, and being mindful of existing expectations and skills of both nurses and patients.},

Method: We examined the changes in seven quality measures reported in HHC from 2003 to 2007. We used a linear regression model to examine whether quality changes over time differed by agency characteristics. Results: We found improvements in quality after HHC in the indicators that measure patients’ ability to independently manage daily activities; however, the use of emergent care did not change, and hospitalization rates increased during the study period. Agencies with low quality at baseline, not-for-profit or hospital-based agencies, and agencies with longer Medicare tenure showed greater improvement for some quality measures than their counterparts. Discussion: There was large variation in the degree of quality improvement after HHC by quality indicators and by agency characteristics.},

Intercoder reliability, more specifically termed intercoder agreement, is a measure of the extent to which independent judges make the same coding decisions in evaluating the characteristics of messages, and is at the heart of this method. Yet there are few standard and accessible guidelines available regarding the appropriate procedures to use to assess and report intercoder reliability, or software tools to calculate it. As a result, it seems likely that there is little consistency in how this critical element of content analysis is assessed and reported in published mass communication studies. Following a review of relevant concepts, indices, and tools, a content analysis of 200 studies utilizing content analysis published in the communication literature between 1994 and 1998 is used to characterize practices in the field. The results demonstrate that mass communication researchers often fail to assess (or at least report) intercoder reliability and often rely on percent agreement, an overly liberal index. Based on the review and these results, concrete guidelines are offered regarding procedures for assessment and reporting of this important aspect of content analysis.},

	abstract = {The rejection of reliability and validity in qualitative inquiry in the 1980s has resulted in an interesting shift for "ensuring rigor" from the investigator’s actions during the course of the research, to the reader or consumer of qualitative inquiry. The emphasis on strategies that are implemented during the research process has been replaced by strategies for evaluating trustworthiness and utility that are implemented once a study is completed. In this article, we argue that reliability and validity remain appropriate concepts for attaining rigor in qualitative research. We argue that qualitative researchers should reclaim responsibility for reliability and validity by implementing verification strategies integral and self-correcting during the conduct of inquiry itself. This ensures the attainment of rigor using strategies inherent within each qualitative design, and moves the responsibility for incorporating and maintaining reliability and validity from external reviewers’ judgements to the investigators themselves. Finally, we make a plea for a return to terminology for ensuring rigor that is used by mainstream science.},

Study Design Fixed-effects regression analysis of the impact of HIT at NHFs on adverse birth outcomes and resource use. Principal Findings Greater use of clinical HIT applications by NHFs is associated with reduced incidence of obstetric trauma and preventable complications, as well as longer lengths of stay. In addition, the beneficial effects of HIT increase the longer that technologies have been in use. However, we find no consistent evidence on whether or how nonclinical HIT in NHFs affects either resource use or health outcomes.

Method Four focus group interviews with 20 nurses who work in home care. A qualitative thematic analysis was performed. Results One main theme was identified: struggling with responsibility in different situations. It comprises five subthemes: poor work morale and work ethic; documentation; lack of functional leadership; competence; and lack of updated routines and guidelines. Conclusions Patient safety culture is compromised by a lack of leadership, lack of responsibility among leadership, lack of routines, failure to update procedures, and a lack of knowledge and education among health-care workers. Implications for nursing management Nurse managers need to be made more aware of the dilemmas faced by nurses, how they struggle with their responsibilities, how they experience powerlessness in certain situations, and the lack of support they receive in decision-making.},

How providers of care are adapting to the changes in their environment and the effect this has on nurses’ job satisfaction has not been explored. Nurses’ job satisfaction provides an indicator of a change in the system’s ability to deliver quality patient care and to attract and retain staff. The purpose of this study is to describe the level of job satisfaction of home health care nurses in three regions of the country. Neal’s theory of becoming a home health nurse was used as a framework for understanding the findings. Nurses in this study were satisfied with aspects of their job related to professional autonomy, relationships with patients and peers, and a sense that their work is worthwhile and important. They are less satisfied with their relationship to administration and their ability to effect changes in the system.},

High-quality (n = 6) and low-quality (n = 6) home health agencies were recruited using agency-level publicly reported patient outcomes. Direct care registered nurses (RNs) from each agency participated in a focus group and completed the Practice Environment Scale of the Nurse Work Index (PES-NWI). No significant differences were found in the PES-NWI results between nurses working in high- and low-quality agencies, though nurses in high-quality agencies scored higher on all subscales. Nurses working in all the high-quality agencies identified themes of adequate staffing, supportive managers, and team work. These themes were not consistently identified in low-quality agencies. Themes of supportive managers and team work are reflective of effective leadership at the manager level. Agencies struggling to improve quality of care might consider developing their managers’ leadership skills.},

Second, aides said they often receive little advance notice about when the case would close. Abrupt transitions are hard for aides, families, and patients who have often built up a good relationship.

The results reveal that registered nurses are in effect guests in a person’s home. Registered nurses’ everyday work comprises advanced nursing care, making difficult decisions, and solving fundamental nursing problems. Registered nurses have a negative attitude to using evidence-based knowledge. The conclusions show that the demand for advanced nursing care competence has increased. As consultants, registered nurses need to delegate and teach the staff basic nursing care. They need to develop competencies in psychiatric and palliative nursing care and improve their handling of specific items of technical equipment.},

A total of 40 patients, 35 informal caregivers, and 15 clinicians participated in this study. Patients recalled receiving discharge instructions but with few details and limited information about follow-up actions if they had problems. Discharge instructions were a versatile means of communication. Home health clinicians used these instructions to guide discussions with patients and their caregivers. Both informal caregivers and home health care clinicians emphasized the inadequate preparation of caregivers during the discharge process. More attention is needed to proactively engage informal caregivers and involve home health clinicians who can facilitate the implementation of discharge plans to improve patient outcomes.},

The category “Being prepared” and subcategories “Importance of leadership strategies,” “Training promotes safety and independence,” and “Co-operation for professional development” were identified. Organizing and planning continuous learning activities at a managerial level, such as collaborations with a focus on supervision and sense of coherence (SOC) training, could develop patient safety within home health care. The results demonstrate that professionally competent nurses working in home health care environments contribute to safe working practices to meet quality care outcomes.},

Most respondents perceived the services described as useful, including having the case manager send a list of medications and send psychotropic medication recommendations per consulting psychiatrist. Most physicians reported being likely to read a written summary sent by the case manager, reply, and send it back to the case manager. Preferred communication procedures varied widely.

There are fewer instances of conflict between physician and nurse in this setting, as doctors yield more responsibility to nurses than they may in hospitals.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The NHS is moving towards electronic access to health records for patients from 2004 and needs to involve patients in the development process. The aim of the study was to explore the views of a large sample of patients about online access to EPRs and health information in primary care. Areas covered included: accuracy rights of access; security; confidentiality and smart cards.
MATERIAL/METHODS: The questionnaire was sent to 1050 patients selected at random from the practice list after stratification for age and sex.
RESULTS: 66\% of patients aged over 20 years old responded. Patients know they have the right to see their records although few have done so. Overall they feel the advantages of electronic health records outweigh the disadvantages. They have concerns about security, confidentiality, understanding their records, their accuracy and completeness. The patients recognised the potential benefits to their healthcare and relationships with health professionals. There was a majority view that parents / guardians and carers should have access to their dependants' records.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients need to be confident that access is limited to those who have the right to see the records. The majority were confident they would understand their records and about half were familiar with computer use. However these are major issues for older patients who will require assistance in order to benefit from accessing their EPRs. It is essential that patient involvement takes place at every stage of the development of EPRs and that their views are taken into account.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the policy making process, implementation by NHS organisations, and patients' and carers' experiences of efforts to introduce an internet accessible personal electronic health record (HealthSpace) in a public sector healthcare system.
DESIGN: Mixed method, multilevel case study.
SETTING: English National Health Service; the basic HealthSpace technology (available throughout England) and the advanced version (available in a few localities where this option had been introduced) were considered.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: National statistics on invitations sent, HealthSpace accounts created, and interviews and ethnographic observation of patients and carers. Data analysis was informed by a socio-technical approach which considered macro and micro influences on both adoption and non-adoption of innovations, and by the principles of critical discourse analysis.
PARTICIPANTS: 56 patients and carers (of whom 21 opened a basic HealthSpace account, 20 had diabetes but were not initially using HealthSpace, and 15 used advanced HealthSpace accounts to exchange messages with their general practitioner), 3000 pages of documents (policies, strategies, business plans, minutes of meetings, correspondence), observational field notes, and 160 interviews with policy makers, project managers, and clinical staff.
RESULTS: Between 2007 and October 2010, 172 950 people opened a basic HealthSpace account. 2913 (0.13\% of those invited) opened an advanced account, compared with 5-10\% of the population anticipated in the original business case. Overall, patients perceived HealthSpace as neither useful nor easy to use and its functionality aligned poorly with their expectations and self management practices. Those who used email-style messaging were positive about its benefits, but enthusiasm beyond three early adopter clinicians was low, and fewer than 100 of 30 000 patients expressed interest. Policy makers' hopes that "deploying" HealthSpace would lead to empowered patients, personalised care, lower NHS costs, better data quality, and improved health literacy were not realised over the three year evaluation period.
CONCLUSION: Unless personal electronic health records align closely with people's attitudes, self management practices, identified information needs, and the wider care package (including organisational routines and incentive structures for clinicians), the risk that they will be abandoned or not adopted at all is substantial. Conceptualising such records dynamically (as components of a socio-technical network) rather than statically (as containers for data) and employing user centred design techniques might improve their chances of adoption and use. The findings raise questions about how eHealth programmes in England are developed and approved at policy level.},

	abstract = {Recently there has been a remarkable upsurge in activity surrounding the adoption of personal health record (PHR) systems for patients and consumers. The biomedical literature does not yet adequately describe the potential capabilities and utility of PHR systems. In addition, the lack of a proven business case for widespread deployment hinders PHR adoption. In a 2005 working symposium, the American Medical Informatics Association's College of Medical Informatics discussed the issues surrounding personal health record systems and developed recommendations for PHR-promoting activities. Personal health record systems are more than just static repositories for patient data; they combine data, knowledge, and software tools, which help patients to become active participants in their own care. When PHRs are integrated with electronic health record systems, they provide greater benefits than would stand-alone systems for consumers. This paper summarizes the College Symposium discussions on PHR systems and provides definitions, system characteristics, technical architectures, benefits, barriers to adoption, and strategies for increasing adoption.},

The English system "Summary Care Record" (SCR) provided access to patients through "HealthSpace," though has now been replaced by encouraging access to GP records. Denmark and Ireland also provided access rights to patients so they could view their records. Romania, Croatia, and Greece do not have national systems.

	volume = {8},
	issn = {1932-6203},
	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0063522},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physical activity is inversely correlated to morbidity and mortality risk. Large cohort studies use wearable accelerometer devices to measure physical activity objectively, providing data potentially relevant to identify different activity patterns and to correlate these to health-related outcome measures. A method to compute relevant characteristics of such data not only with regard to duration and intensity, but also to regularity of activity events, is necessary. The aims of this paper are to propose a new method--the ATLAS index (Activity Types from Long-term Accelerometric Sensor data)--to derive generic measures for distinguishing different characteristic activity phenotypes from accelerometer data, to propose a comprehensive graphical representation, and to conduct a proof-of-concept with long-term measurements from different devices and cohorts.
METHODS: The ATLAS index consists of the three dimensions regularity (reg), duration (dur) and intensity (int) of relevant activity events identified in long-term accelerometer data. It can be regarded as a 3D vector and represented in a 3D cube graph. 12 exemplary data sets of three different cohort studies with 99,467 minutes of data were chosen for concept validation.
RESULTS: Five archetypical activity types are proposed along with their dimensional characteristics (insufficiently active: low reg, int and dur; busy bee: low dur and int, high reg; cardio-active: medium reg, int and dur, endurance athlete: high reg, int and dur; and weekend warrior: high int and dur, low reg). The data sets are displayed in one common graph, indicating characteristic differences in activity patterns.
CONCLUSION: The ATLAS index incorporates the relevant regularity dimension apart from the widely-used measures of duration and intensity. Along with the 3D representation, it allows to compare different activity types in cohort study populations, both visually and computationally using vector distance measures. Further research is necessary to validate the ATLAS index in order to find normative values and group centroids.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Activity monitors are widely used in research, and are currently being used to study physical activity (PA) trends in the US and Canada. The purpose of this study was to determine if body mass index (BMI) affects the step count accuracy of commonly used accelerometer-based activity monitors during treadmill walking.
METHODS: Participants were classified into BMI categories and instructed to walk on a treadmill at 3 different speeds (40, 67, and 94 m·min(-1)) while wearing 4 accelerometer-based activity monitors (ActiGraph GT1M, ActiCal, NL-2000, and StepWatch).
RESULTS: There was no significant main effect of BMI on pedometer accuracy. At the slowest speed, all waist-mounted devices significantly underestimated actual steps (P {\textless} .001), with the NL-2000 recording the greatest percentage (72\%). At the intermediate speed, the ActiGraph was the least accurate, recording only 80\% of actual steps. At the fastest speed, all of the activity monitors demonstrated a high level of accuracy.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that BMI does not greatly affect the step-counting accuracy of accelerometer-based activity monitors. However, the accuracy of the ActiGraph, ActiCal, and NL-2000 decreases at slower speeds. The ankle-mounted StepWatch was the most accurate device across a wide range of walking speeds.},

The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of BMI and abdominal volume on the accuracy of a step count obtained from a tri-axial accelerometer. Accelerometers were placed directly onto the skin at the chest, waist and lower back of 12 participants. Participants then walked on a motorized treadmill at 0.89 m/s and 1.34 m/s. Analysis of the results indicated that BMI and abdominal volume did not affect the accuracy of the step count obtained from accelerometers under any conditions.

This study examined crucial links between HITs and quality of service provided through an empirical investigation of 252 patients in a hospital-in-the-home unit (HHU) in a Spanish regional hospital. The study sought to test the relationship between HITs and the quality of service using factor analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM) to investigate how HITs mediate effects of organisational learning on quality of service. Findings support the notion that the relationship between organisational learning and quality of service can be mediated by HITs.

	abstract = {Effective communication and teamwork is essential for the delivery of high quality, safe patient care. Communication failures are an extremely common cause of inadvertent patient harm. The complexity of medical care, coupled with the inherent limitations of human performance, make it critically important that clinicians have standardised communication tools, create an environment in which individuals can speak up and express concerns, and share common "critical language" to alert team members to unsafe situations. All too frequently, effective communication is situation or personality dependent. Other high reliability domains, such as commercial aviation, have shown that the adoption of standardised tools and behaviours is a very effective strategy in enhancing teamwork and reducing risk. We describe our ongoing patient safety implementation using this approach within Kaiser Permanente, a non-profit American healthcare system providing care for 8.3 million patients. We describe specific clinical experience in the application of surgical briefings, properties of high reliability perinatal care, the value of critical event training and simulation, and benefits of a standardised communication process in the care of patients transferred from hospitals to skilled nursing facilities. Additionally, lessons learned as to effective techniques in achieving cultural change, evidence of improving the quality of the work environment, practice transfer strategies, critical success factors, and the evolving methods of demonstrating the benefit of such work are described.},

Results of interventions were summarized by their effect on timeliness, accuracy, completeness, and overall quality of the information transfer.Data Synthesis Direct communication between hospital physicians and primary care physicians occurred infrequently (3\%-20\%). The availability of a discharge summary at the first postdischarge visit was low (12\%-34\%) and remained poor at 4 weeks (51\%-77\%), affecting the quality of care in approximately 25\% of follow-up visits and contributing to primary care physician dissatisfaction. Discharge summaries often lacked important information such as diagnostic test results (missing from 33\%-63\%), treatment or hospital course (7\%-22\%), discharge medications (2\%-40\%), test results pending at discharge (65\%), patient or family counseling (90\%-92\%), and follow-up plans (2\%-43\%). Several interventions, including computer-generated discharge summaries and using patients as couriers, shortened the delivery time of discharge communications. Use of standardized formats to highlight the most pertinent information improved the perceived quality of documents.Conclusions Deficits in communication and information transfer at hospital discharge are common and may adversely affect patient care. Interventions such as computer-generated summaries and standardized formats may facilitate more timely transfer of pertinent patient information to primary care physicians and make discharge summaries more consistently available during follow-up care.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Homecare is an important and effective way of managing chronic illnesses using skilled nursing care in the home. Unlike hospitals and ambulatory settings, clinicians visit patients at home at different times, independent of each other. Twenty-nine percent of 10,000 homecare agencies in the United States have adopted point-of-care EHRs. Yet, relatively little is known about the growing use of homecare EHRs.
OBJECTIVE: Researchers compared workflow, financial billing, and patient outcomes before and after implementation to evaluate the impact of a homecare point-of-care EHR.
METHODS: The design was a pre/post observational study embedded in a mixed methods study. The setting was a Philadelphia-based homecare agency with 137 clinicians. Data sources included: (1) clinician EHR documentation completion; (2) EHR usage data; (3) Medicare billing data; (4) an EHR Nurse Satisfaction survey; (5) clinician observations; (6) clinician interviews; and (7) patient outcomes.
RESULTS: Clinicians were satisfied with documentation timeliness and team communication. Following EHR implementation, 90\% of notes were completed within the 1-day compliance interval (n = 56,702) compared with 30\% of notes completed within the 7-day compliance interval in the pre-implementation period (n = 14,563; OR 19, p {\textless}. 001). Productivity in the number of clinical notes documented post-implementation increased almost 10-fold compared to pre-implementation. Days to Medicare claims fell from 100 days pre-implementation to 30 days post-implementation, while the census rose. EHR implementation impact on patient outcomes was limited to some behavioral outcomes.
DISCUSSION: Findings from this homecare EHR study indicated clinician EHR use enabled a sustained increase in productivity of note completion, as well as timeliness of documentation and billing for reimbursement with limited impact on improving patient outcomes. As EHR adoption increases to better meet the needs of the growing population of older people with chronic health conditions, these results can inform homecare EHR development and implementation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nursing documentation is the record of care that is planned and given to patients, yet it is often missing or incomplete. A study of translating results from nurses' assessments of fall risk into tailored interventions using health information technology was used to examine nursing documentation of risk assessment, plans to manage those risks, and interventions to prevent falls.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an electronic fall prevention toolkit for promoting documentation of fall risk status and planned and completed fall prevention interventions.
METHODS: Nursing documentation related to fall risk and prevention was reviewed in 30\% of randomly selected medical records for patients on the eight study units (four intervention units; 5,267 patients) and four usual care units (5,116 patients) during three separate study visits.
RESULTS: Patients on the intervention units were more likely to have fall risk documented (89\% vs. 64\%, p {\textless} .0001). There were significantly more comprehensive plans of care for the patients on the interventions documented, although no differences were found related to documentation of completed interventions compared with usual care unit patient records.
DISCUSSION: The documentation of fall risk status and planned interventions tailored to patient-specific areas of risk was significantly better on the intervention units that used the fall prevention toolkit as compared with usual care units. Improved documentation quality did not extend to the documentation of completed interventions.},

	abstract = {Objective
To examine associations between nursing homes' quality and publication of the Nursing Home Compare quality report card.

Data Sources/Study Settings
Primary and secondary data for 2001–2003: 701 survey responses of a random sample of nursing homes; the Minimum Data Set (MDS) with information about all residents in these facilities, and the Nursing Home Compare published quality measure (QM) scores.

Study Design
Survey responses provided information on 20 specific actions taken by nursing homes in response to publication of the report card. MDS data were used to calculate five QMs for each quarter, covering a period before and following publication of the report. Statistical regression techniques were used to determine if trends in these QMs have changed following publication of the report card in relation to actions undertaken by nursing homes.

Principal Findings
Two of the five QMs show improvement following publication. Several specific actions were associated with these improvements.

Conclusions
Publication of the Nursing Home Compare report card was associated with improvement in some but not all reported dimensions of quality. This suggests that report cards may motivate providers to improve quality, but it also raises questions as to why it was not effective across the board.},

	abstract = {Objective
To assess whether differences in strategic orientation of nursing homes as identified by the Miles and Snow typology are associated with differences in their response to the publication of quality measures on the Nursing Home Compare website.

Data Sources
Administrator survey of a national 10 percent random sample (1,502 nursing homes) of all facilities included in the first publication of the Nursing Home Compare report conducted in May–June 2004; 724 responded, yielding a response rate of 48.2 percent.

Study Design
The dependent variables are dichotomous, indicating whether or not action was taken and the type of action taken. Four indicator variables were created for each of the four strategic types: Defender, Analyzer, Prospector, and Reactor. Other variables were included in the seven logistic regression models to control for factors other than strategic type that could influence nursing home response to public disclosure of their quality of care.

Data Collection/Extraction Methods
Survey data were merged with data on quality measures and organizational characteristics from the first report (November 2002).

Principal Findings
About 43 percent of surveyed administrators self-typed as Defenders, followed by Analyzers (33 percent), and Prospectors (19 percent). The least self-selected strategic type was the Reactor (6.6 percent). In general, results of the regression models indicate differences in response to quality measure publication by strategic type, with Prospectors and Analyzers more likely, and Reactors less likely, to respond than Defenders.

Conclusions
While almost a third of administrators took no action at all, our results indicate that whether, when, and how nursing homes reacted to publication of federally reported quality measures is associated with strategic orientation.},

	doi = {10.1097/MLR.0b013e31816099c5},
	abstract = {Background
CMS publishes a report card for nursing homes with 19 clinical quality measures (QMs). These measures include minimal risk adjustment.

Objectives
To develop quality measures with more extensive risk adjustment and to investigate the impact on quality rankings.

Research Design
Retrospective analysis of individual level data reported in the Minimum Data Set (MDS). Random effect logistic models were used to estimate risk adjustment models for 5 outcomes: pressure ulcers for high and low risk patients, physical restraints, and pain for long- and short-stay patients. These models were used to create 5 quality measures with extended risk adjustment, EQMs. The EQMs were compared to the corresponding QMs.

Subjects
All (17,469) nursing homes that reported MDS data in the period 2001-2005, and their 9.6 million residents.

Measures
QMs were compared with EQMs for all nursing homes in terms of agreement on outlier identification: Kappa, false positive and false negative error rates.

Results
Kappa values ranged from 0.63 to 0.90. False positive and negative error rates ranged from 8\% to 37\%. Agreement between QMs and EQMs was better on high quality rather than on low quality.

Conclusions
More extensive risk adjustment changes quality ranking of nursing homes and should be considered as potential improvement to the current QMs. Other methodological issues related to construction of the QMs should also be investigated to determine if they are important in the context of nursing home care.},

We designated “high” and “low” performers for each rating system and examined the overlap among rating systems and how hospital characteristics corresponded with performance on each. No hospital was rated as a high performer by all four national rating systems. Only 10 percent of the 844 hospitals rated as a high performer by one rating system were rated as a high performer by any of the other rating systems. The lack of agreement among the national hospital rating systems is likely explained by the fact that each system uses its own rating methods, has a different focus to its ratings, and stresses different measures of performance.},

	abstract = {The adverse events data of randomized clinical trials are often analyzed based on either crude incidence rates or exposure-adjusted incidence rates. These rates do not adequately account for an individual patient's profile of adverse events over the study period when an individual may remain in the trial after experiencing one or more events (i.e., occurrence of multiple events of the same kind or different kinds). Moreover, the required statistical assumptions (e.g., constant hazard rate over time) for valid estimates of incidence rates are not likely to be met in practice by adverse events data of clinical trials. A nonparametric approach called the mean cumulative function (MCF) provides a valid statistical inference on recurrent adverse event profiles of drugs in randomized clinical trials. The estimate involves no assumptions about the form of MCF. To demonstrate the applicability and utility of the MCF approach in clinical trial datasets, an adverse event dataset obtained from a clinical trial is analyzed in this article. As compared to the crude or exposure-adjusted incidence rates of adverse events, the MCF estimates facilitate more understanding of safety profiles of a drug in a randomized clinical trial.},

A substantial informational burden is incurred with each patient visit to a health professional, and patients' needs are often lost in the shuffle of medical records, insurance information, and red tape. However during the last few years significant progress has been made in the development of clinically useful medical decision support system to assist the health care provider. Earlier efforts to implement computer-based patient records mainly used keyboard entry, but with the latest technology, voice activated clinical reporting systems could be a central component of such a computer-based system in the future. Several groups are in the process of developing portable data management device. This will allow the clinicians to have on-line readily transferable patient records, decision making support and searching of remote databases to better analyze complex health care delivery problems. When the medical transcriptions are forwarded to an off-site location, this unique device will reduce the time and the cost of re-recording and transmission. This device will help the user to maintain and update the data remotely and instantly. It will also provide immediate information updates and database manipulations for all aspects of medical data management, provide portable multiple and simultaneous access to complete database information.

Western Sydney Area Health Service (WSAHS or the Area) is a large public health institution under the state government of New South Wales, situated in the western suburbs of Sydney, Australia. WSAHS provides health care to a patient base of 1.4 million people. Total capacity is 2000 beds. It employs over 10000 staff and has an operating budget of \$A900 million per year. Despite achieving productivity gains of 10\% per year over the last seven years (1991-98), the waiting lists have continued to grow. Being dependent on public funding, the Area had to find a more dramatic approach than the TQM methods to date. Of the several options considered, the business process reengineering (BPR) approach of the US Military Health Services, and the Mayo Clinic Scottsdale's effort of multi-disciplinary technique to implement organisational changes seemed particularly attractive. It was therefore decided to embark upon a BPR project to reengineer the Patient Flow and Billing processes. The benefits to the Western Sydney Area Health Service are significant. First there is greatly enhanced service to the patient. Then there is improvement in relationship with the patients, and with the visiting medical officers. Finally there is a major improvement in the cash flow and bad debt recovery.},

The network so far involves EDI (letter of discharge, test results, bills, etc.) and access to waiting lists at the hospital. The participants include about 75\% of the GPs, the pharmacies, the health insurance and the hospitals. Future plans for the network includes expansion of the network to additional areas in the health sector, as well as new functional items, such as medical records. On a national scale, aims are to link all counties in a national health data network. Using a framework adopted from Andersen and Danziger (1995), the study show that there are benefits in terms of the capabilities and the interaction among the actors involved. Also, the increased reliance on computerized information has improved the service in the health sector. However, improvements of each of these three variables are in part a compromise (trade off) with privacy issues not only in terms of patients' privacy and protection of legal rights, but also the doctors' concept of “professional privacy” pose challenges to the potential expansion of the health data network},

A set of static measures were employed as predictor variables. While doing so, we observed that a large portion of the modules were small, as measured by lines of code (LOC). When we experimented on the data subsets created by partitioning according to module size, we obtained higher prediction performance for the subsets that include larger modules. We also performed defect prediction using class-level data for KC1 rather than the method-level data. In this case, the use of class-level data resulted in improved prediction performance compared to using method-level data. These findings suggest that quality assurance activities can be guided even better if defect prediction is performed by using data that belong to larger modules.},

	abstract = {Home health care services are expanding at a rapid pace in order to meet the needs of the growing population of older adults and those with chronic illnesses. Because of current restrictions on home health care as an insured service in some countries, individuals may be required to pay for some or all of their home care services out of pocket. These payments may potentially limit access to needed home care services for persons in the lowest socioeconomic strata. Previous research demonstrates a clear socioeconomic gradient in access to acute and primary care services, where those most in need of services are the most disadvantaged and under-serviced. There has been little attention paid thus far, however, to the way in which socioeconomic status may affect the receipt of home health care services.
Objective
To determine what is known from existing literature about socioeconomic disparities in home health care access and utilization.
Design
A scoping review was used to map the extent and nature of the literature in this area.
Data sources
A search of the databases CINAHL, Medline, SocIndex and Sociological Abstracts as well as Dissertations International.
Review methods
A total of 206 potentially relevant articles were published between 2000 and April 2011. Two reviewers independently reviewed the articles, leaving 15 research articles to be included in the scoping review.
Results
The majority of articles reported secondary analyses of administrative datasets related to utilization of home health care. Several studies examined access and utilization using qualitative approaches. The distinction between professional and supportive home care services was not always clear in the articles. Individual and composite measures of socioeconomic status were reported, with the most frequently used indicator being income. Several studies used more complex composite ecological indicators of socieconomic status. There was general agreement that utilization of home health services favored persons with greater economic disadvantage. Education, rurality and race were less frequently reported.
Conclusions
In contrast to well-documented socioeconomic gradient seen with primary and acute care services, we found general agreement that persons of lower socioeconomic status are favored and not disadvantaged in terms of home health care services.},

Many promising innovations in service delivery currently exist, a wide variety of which have been tested and evaluated in postacute and long-term care settings. Our review found that home health agencies are well positioned to improve patient outcomes through a variety of approaches, including care coordination, telehealth, and data-driven quality of care monitoring.

	abstract = {A root cause is a source of software defect, whose removal decreases or removes the defect. A root cause of software defect is injected into the software by software engineers during the development process. One of the main concerns of the software team leader, such as the project manager, is to determine who injected various root causes of the defects into the software and when these have been injected. In this paper, a cost-benefit scheme is presented, which allows a software team to determine skill weakness and improve team capability. The scheme provides effective in-process feedback based on the causal analysis of software defects. The proposed analysis scheme includes orthogonal root cause definitions, role-based root cause types, and gradational correction actions. In the experiment, the projects of a distributed health-care system are used to verify the efficiency of the proposed scheme. The results show that the root cause ratios (RCR) are 33.8\%, 30.6\%, 21.9\%, 10.7\%, and 3.0\% in design, implementation, analysis, business and deployment, respectively. The defects in the projects mainly occurred during the design and implementation phases of the projects. Correction activities to enhance the designers’ skills, such as exception handling (40.5\%) and DB/data schema (25.0\%), are the top priorities that must be addressed by the software team. The findings can help the team leader to determine methods to improve these weaknesses.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES
To compare readmissions of Medicare recipients of usual home care and a matched group of recipients of a restorative model of home care.

DESIGN
Quasiexperimental; matched and unmatched.

SETTING
Community, home care.

PARTICIPANTS
Seven hundred seventy individuals receiving care from a large home care agency after hospitalization.

INTERVENTION
A restorative care model based on principles adapted from geriatric medicine, nursing, rehabilitation, goal attainment, chronic care management, and behavioral change theory.

MEASUREMENTS
Hospital readmission, length of home care episode.

RESULTS
Among the matched pairs, 13.2\% of participants who received restorative care were readmitted to an acute hospital during the episode of home care, versus 17.6\% of those who received usual care. Individuals receiving the restorative model of home care were 32\% less likely to be readmitted than those receiving usual care (conditional odds ratio = 0.68, 95\% confidence interval = 0.43–1.08). The mean length of home care episodes was 20.3 ± 14.8 days in the restorative care group and 29.1 ± 31.7 days in the usual care group (P {\textless} .001). Results were similar in unmatched analyses.

CONCLUSION
Although statistical significance was marginal, results suggest that the restorative care model offers an effective approach to reducing the occurrence of avoidable readmissions. It was previously shown that the restorative model of home care was associated with better functional recovery, fewer emergency department visits, and shorter episodes of home care. This model could be incorporated into usual home care practices and care delivery redesign.},

This is a significant barrier to developing strategies to reduce risk, performing evidence-based research and evaluating existing healthcare policies relevant to patient safety. Since 2005, the World Health Organization's World Alliance for Patient Safety has undertaken the Project to Develop an International Classification for Patient Safety (ICPS) to devise a classification which transforms patient safety information collected from disparate systems into a common format to facilitate aggregation, analysis and learning across disciplines, borders and time. A drafting group, comprised of experts from the fields of patient safety, classification theory, health informatics, consumer/patient advocacy, law and medicine, identified and defined key patient safety concepts and developed an internationally agreed conceptual framework for the ICPS based upon existing patient safety classifications. The conceptual framework was iteratively improved through technical expert meetings and a two-stage web-based modified Delphi survey of over 250 international experts. This work culminated in a conceptual framework consisting of ten high level classes: incident type, patient outcomes, patient characteristics, incident characteristics, contributing factors/hazards, organizational outcomes, detection, mitigating factors, ameliorating actions and actions taken to reduce risk. While the framework for the ICPS is in place, several challenges remain. Concepts need to be defined, guidance for using the classification needs to be provided, and further real-world testing needs to occur to progressively refine the ICPS to ensure it is fit for purpose.},

	abstract = {Background
To date, no study to our knowledge has examined the nature and scope of medical error in dermatology practice.
Objective
We sought to collect and categorize physician-reported errors in dermatology practice.
Methods
A survey regarding most recent and most serious errors was developed and distributed to dermatologists attending US meetings. A total of 150 responses were received outlining 152 most recent errors and 130 most serious errors. Survey responses, along with classification systems for other specialties, were used to develop a classification system for medical error in dermatology.
Results
The respondents’ demographics reflected the specialty: 63\% were male, 60\% were older than 50 years, and 60\% were in solo or group private practice. Of the most recent errors reported, 85\% happened once a year or less, and 86\% did not result in harm to patients. The most common categories of both most recent and most serious errors were related to assessment (41\% and 31\%, respectively) and interventions (44\% and 52\%, respectively). Assessment errors were primarily related to investigations, and commonly involved the biopsy pathway. Intervention errors in the most recent and most serious errors were split between those related to medication (54\% and 27\%) and those related to procedures (46\% and 73\%). Of note, 5 and 21 wrong-site surgeries were reported in the most recent and most serious errors groups, respectively.
Limitations
Our findings are subject to respondent and recall bias and our classification system, although an important first step, is likely incomplete.
Conclusion
Our findings highlight several key areas of patient care in need of safety initiatives, namely the biopsy pathway, medication management, and prevention of wrong-site surgery.},

	abstract = {To understand medication errors and to identify preventive strategies, we need to classify them and define the terms that describe them.
            
            
              The four main approaches to defining technical terms consider etymology, usage, previous definitions, and the Ramsey–Lewis method (based on an understanding of theory and practice).
            
            
              A medication error is ‘a failure in the treatment process that leads to, or has the potential to lead to, harm to the patient’.
            
            
              Prescribing faults, a subset of medication errors, should be distinguished from prescription errors. A prescribing fault is ‘a failure in the prescribing [decision-making] process that leads to, or has the potential to lead to, harm to the patient’. The converse of this, ‘balanced prescribing’ is ‘the use of a medicine that is appropriate to the patient's condition and, within the limits created by the uncertainty that attends therapeutic decisions, in a dosage regimen that optimizes the balance of benefit to harm’. This excludes all forms of prescribing faults, such as irrational, inappropriate, and ineffective prescribing, underprescribing and overprescribing.
            
            
              A prescription error is ‘a failure in the prescription writing process that results in a wrong instruction about one or more of the normal features of a prescription’. The ‘normal features’ include the identity of the recipient, the identity of the drug, the formulation, dose, route, timing, frequency, and duration of administration.
            
            
              Medication errors can be classified, invoking psychological theory, as knowledge-based mistakes, rule-based mistakes, action-based slips, and memory-based lapses. This classification informs preventive strategies.},

This was incorporated in an anonymous self-report form which was then used to collect information on errors during June 2002. The acceptability of the reporting process was assessed using a self-completion questionnaire. , Setting: UK general practice. , Participants: Ten general practices in the North East of England. , Main outcome measures: Classification of errors, frequency of errors, error rates per 1000 appointments, acceptability of the process to participants. , Results: 101 events were used to create an initial error classification. This contained six categories: prescriptions, communication, appointments, equipment, clinical care, and "other" errors. Subsequently, 940 errors were recorded in a single 2 week period from 10 practices, providing additional information. 42\% (397/940) were related to prescriptions, although only 6\% (22/397) of these were medication errors. Communication errors accounted for 30\% (282/940) of errors and clinical errors 3\% (24/940). The overall error rate was 75.6/1000 appointments (95\% CI 71 to 80). The method of error reporting was found to be acceptable by 68\% (36/53) of respondents with only 8\% (4/53) finding the process threatening. , Conclusion: We have developed a classification of errors and described a practical and acceptable method for reporting them that can be used as part of the process of risk management.

In this study, we aim to accumulate and reinterpret findings using structured incident information, to clarify improvements that should be made to solve the root cause of the accident, and to ensure safe medical treatment through such improvements. We employ natural language processing (NLP) and network analysis to identify effective categories of medical incident reports. Network analysis can find various relationships that are not only direct but also indirect. In addition, we compare bottom-up results obtained by NLP with existing categories based on experts' judgment. By the bottom-up analysis, the class of patient managements regarding patients' fallings and medicines in top-down analysis is created clearly.

This hinders systematic application of data obtained from incident reports, and learning from near misses and adverse events.Objective. To develop a common terminology and classification schema (taxonomy) for collecting and organizing patient safety data.Methods. The project comprised a systematic literature review; evaluation of existing patient safety terminologies and classifications, and identification of those that should be included in the core set of a standardized taxonomy; assessment of the taxonomy’s face and content validity; the gathering of input from patient safety stakeholders in multiple disciplines; and a preliminary study of the taxonomy’s comparative reliability.Results. Elements (terms) and structures (data fields) from existing classification schemes and reporting systems could be grouped into five complementary root nodes or primary classifications: impact, type, domain, cause, and prevention and mitigation. The root nodes were then divided into 21 subclassifications which in turn are subdivided into more than 200 coded categories and an indefinite number of uncoded text fields to capture narrative information. An earlier version of the taxonomy (n = 111 coded categories) demonstrated acceptable comparability with the categorized data requirements of the ICU safety reporting system.Conclusions. The results suggest that the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) Patient Safety Event Taxonomy could facilitate a common approach for patient safety information systems. Having access to standardized data would make it easier to file patient safety event reports and to conduct root cause analyses in a consistent fashion.},

	abstract = {Background
To date, no study to our knowledge has examined the nature and scope of medical error in dermatology practice.
Objective
We sought to collect and categorize physician-reported errors in dermatology practice.
Methods
A survey regarding most recent and most serious errors was developed and distributed to dermatologists attending US meetings. A total of 150 responses were received outlining 152 most recent errors and 130 most serious errors. Survey responses, along with classification systems for other specialties, were used to develop a classification system for medical error in dermatology.
Results
The respondents’ demographics reflected the specialty: 63\% were male, 60\% were older than 50 years, and 60\% were in solo or group private practice. Of the most recent errors reported, 85\% happened once a year or less, and 86\% did not result in harm to patients. The most common categories of both most recent and most serious errors were related to assessment (41\% and 31\%, respectively) and interventions (44\% and 52\%, respectively). Assessment errors were primarily related to investigations, and commonly involved the biopsy pathway. Intervention errors in the most recent and most serious errors were split between those related to medication (54\% and 27\%) and those related to procedures (46\% and 73\%). Of note, 5 and 21 wrong-site surgeries were reported in the most recent and most serious errors groups, respectively.
Limitations
Our findings are subject to respondent and recall bias and our classification system, although an important first step, is likely incomplete.
Conclusion
Our findings highlight several key areas of patient care in need of safety initiatives, namely the biopsy pathway, medication management, and prevention of wrong-site surgery.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe and classify process errors and preventable adverse events that occur from medical care in outpatient primary care settings.
STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review and synthesis of the medical literature.
DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library from 1965 through March 2001 with the MESH term medical errors, modified by adding family practice, primary health care, physicians/family, or ambulatory care and limited the search to English-language publications. Published bibliographies and Web sites from patient safety and primary care organizations were also reviewed for unpublished reports, presentations, and leads to other sites, journals, or investigators with relevant work. Additional papers were identified from the references of the papers reviewed and from seminal papers in the field.
OUTCOMES MEASURED: Process errors and preventable adverse events.
RESULTS: Four original research studies directly studied and described medical errors and adverse events in primary care, and 3 other studies peripherally addressed primary care medical errors. A variety of quantitative and qualitative methods were used in the studies. Extraction of results from the studies led to a classification of 3 main categories of preventable adverse events: diagnosis, treatment, and preventive services. Process errors were classified into 4 categories: clinician, communication, administration, and blunt end.
CONCLUSIONS: Original research on medical errors in the primary care setting consists of a limited number of small studies that offer a rich description of medical errors and preventable adverse events primarily from the physician's viewpoint. We describe a classification derived from these studies that is based on the actual practice of primary care and provides a starting point for future epidemiologic and interventional research. Missing are studies that have patient, consumer, or other health care provider input.},

The potential effects of increasing numbers of uninsured and underinsured persons on US emergency departments (EDs) is a concern for the health care safety net.

Objective
To describe the changes in ED visits that occurred from 1997 through 2007 in the adult and pediatric US populations by sociodemographic group, designation of safety-net ED, and trends in ambulatory care–sensitive conditions.

Design, Setting, and Participants
Publicly available ED visit data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) from 1997 through 2007 were stratified by age, sex, race, ethnicity, insurance status, safety-net hospital classification, triage category, and disposition. Codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), were used to extract visits related to ambulatory care–sensitive conditions. Visit rates were calculated using annual US Census estimates.

Main Outcome Measures
Total annual visits to US EDs and ED visit rates for population subgroups.

Results
Between 1997 and 2007, ED visit rates increased from 352.8 to 390.5 per 1000 persons (rate difference, 37.7; 95\% confidence interval [CI], −51.1 to 126.5; P=.001 for trend); the increase in total annual ED visits was almost double of what would be expected from population growth. Adults with Medicaid accounted for most of the increase in ED visits; the visit rate increased from 693.9 to 947.2 visits per 1000 enrollees between 1999 and 2007 (rate difference, 253.3; 95\% CI, 41.1 to 465.5; P=.001 for trend). Although ED visit rates for adults with ambulatory care–sensitive conditions remained stable, ED visit rates among adults with Medicaid increased from 66.4 in 1999 to 83.9 in 2007 (rate difference, 17.5; 95\% CI, −5.8 to 40.8; P=.007 for trend). The number of facilities qualifying as safety-net EDs increased from 1770 in 2000 to 2489 in 2007.

Conclusion
These findings indicate that ED visit rates have increased from 1997 to 2007 and that EDs are increasingly serving as the safety net for medically underserved patients, particularly adults with Medicaid.},

METHODS: The authors selected reports meeting five criteria: (1) presentation of new data on medical-surgical hospitalization of adults; (2) measurement of outcome as a person-specific readmission; (3) readmission within {\textless} or = 31 days; (4) examination of some aspect of the process of inpatient care; (5) inclusion of a comparison group. One meta-analysis examined 13 comparisons of readmission rates after substandard versus normative care, another examined 9 comparisons of readmission rates after normative versus exceptional care, and the third examined all 22 comparisons together. Two authors applied inclusion criteria and extracted data on methods and findings. Two others classified studies on 11 methodological variables for the heterogeneity evaluation.
RESULTS: The summary odds ratio for readmission after substandard care was 1.24 (0.99-1.57) relative to normative care; for readmission after normative care the summary odds ratio was 1.45 (0.90-2.33) relative to exceptional care. The individual odds ratios varied significantly (chi2, 21 df = 50.34, P = 0.0003). Most of the variance in study odds ratios could be explained by whether the study focused on the quality of patient care or the qualifications of patient care providers. The summary odds ratio for the 16 homogeneous comparisons focusing on the quality of patient care was 1.55 (1.25-1.92).
CONCLUSIONS: Early readmission is significantly associated with the process of inpatient care. The risk of early readmission is increased by 55\% when care is of relatively low quality, that is, substandard or normative instead of normative or exceptional.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Increases in longevity, a growing elderly population, variation of skill and knowledge among home providers, and a steady migration of medical devices and technologies into the home are placing new demands on home heath care. The paper examines the human factors challenges associated with these converging trends.
METHODS: A growing literature base relevant to home health care is examined, and with the aid of a socio-technical systems model, the paper explores safety and quality concerns to which the converging trends are likely to give rise.
FINDINGS: The sensory, physical, and cognitive limitations of patients and their caregivers play a key role in the ability of patients to manage home health care needs. Other major components affecting successful home health care management are the nature of health care tasks undertaken, the design features of the physical environment, the medical devices and technologies used, the social and community environments, and distal but relevant external factors that shape the context of care. Home health care stakeholders can avoid foreseeable threats to safety and quality by recognizing that components need to be designed in a way that takes into account their interactions with one another and with the capabilities and limitations of patients and their providers.
CONCLUSIONS: By examining the major components and interdependencies of the home health care delivery system, a human factors perspective offers insights into ways that safety and quality can be compromised and can help pave the way for new modes of thinking in home health care policy.},

The aim of this project was to explore the concept of safety in community home health in one health care authority in British Columbia. Methods: A participatory action research approach was employed to explore staff and client safety risks in this environment. In the first phase, three focus groups were held with staff (n = 39) and the data analysed to identify themes. These were validated by additional focus groups. In the second phase, interviews were held with staff followed by chart reviews. Finally, in phase three, an interdisciplinary working group developed a risk identification tool for staff which was subsequently piloted. The exploration focused on answering the following questions: What constitutes safety in community home health care? What are the priority areas for action in relation to safety? What type of risk identification would be most helpful to community health workers to prepare them adequately to meet their clients' and their own safety needs? Results: Risk themes identified included: poor communication, acute care staff not understanding the needs of community staff, working alone, mobility, medication concerns, lack of pre-screening of clients' homes, and community health workers accepting a high degree of risk. Conclusions: Findings suggest that typical notions of safety and risk in acute care are not easily translated into the community sector, that staff and clients' safety concerns are intertwined, and staff require better and more timely information from acute care staff when patients are discharged home.},

Design and Methods: Data from 3,041 Canadian and 11,252 U.S. home care clients assessed with the Minimum Data Set—Home Care (MDS-HC) were used to evaluate a series of indicators suggested by international experts and by focus groups conducted in Canada and the United States. Risk adjustment methods were derived and validated using data from Ontario and Michigan. Results: Of the 73 original candidate HCQIs, 22 were retained for the final list of recommended indicators. All but three indicators include risk adjusters based on individual-level covariates. An agency-level risk adjustment was developed to correct for selection and ascertainment bias. Implications: The HCQIs are new tools providing a first step along the path of quality improvement for home care. These indicators can provide high-quality evidence on performance at the agency level and on a regional basis.},

Quality-of-care evidence from fifteen studies showed an equal number of significantly better and worse HMO results, compared with non-HMO plans. However, in several instances, Medicare HMO enrollees with chronic conditions showed worse quality of care. Evidence comparing hospital and physician resource use showed no clear pattern, whereas evidence on enrollee satisfaction varied by measure and enrollee type. Although recent research provides useful findings, interpreting and generalizing from these relatively few studies is difficult. Fears that HMOs uniformly lead to worse quality of care are not supported by the evidence, although all quality data were collected prior to the recent round of cost cutting that started in 1992. Hopes that HMOs would improve overall quality also are not supported, in part because of slow clinical practice change, lack of risk-adjusted capitation rates, and inadequate quality measurement and reporting.},

	abstract = {The Institute of Medicine defines health care quality as increasing "the likelihood of desired health outcomes" using "services  consistent with current professional knowledge." This definition implies that quality measures can be based on either achieving health care outcomes or completing processes that experts agree have been shown by scientific evidence to improve outcomes. Process-based measures are especially suitable when the user needs to know how to improve quality, when provider comparisons show equivalent outcomes but all providers should improve processes, when measures are needed to evaluate health care that is intended to improve long-term outcomes, or when the contribution of individual providers (especially providers who have a small number of cases) needs to be defined. However, many different process-based measures are needed to comprehensively assess quality, and many process-based measures require detailed clinical data currently found only in medical records. Therefore, the expense of abstracting records is a barrier to process-based measurement. Fortunately, large-scale process-based measures are becoming more feasible because the required clinical data are being included in large databases. The merging of existing inpatient and outpatient databases with pharmacy and laboratory databases is an important step toward obtaining data that link all patient admissions, appointments, diagnostic procedures, and prescriptions with diagnoses and test results. Other data that are valuable for process-based measures must still be obtained by abstracting data from records, including clinical findings, patient preferences, and medical and family history. In the future, such data may be added to large databases to create computerized medical records.},

	abstract = {Objectives
This study aimed to measure awareness and interest among state health information exchanges (HIEs) in a tool that translates long-term post-acute care (LTPAC) patient assessment information to a Continuity of Care Document (CCD) format for sharing; whether any state HIEs currently integrate patient information from LTPAC providers; and the anticipated benefits and barriers to using such a tool.

Materials and Methods
The study consisted of an online survey of state HIEs.

Results
Responses were received from representatives of 29 of the 51 HIEs (57 percent). Eleven of the 29 respondents (38 percent) were aware of the LTPAC-to-CCD translation tool, and 24 (83 percent of respondents) were interested in it or felt LTPAC providers in their state would be interested. Twenty-one of the 24 interested respondents (88 percent) indicated a desire for more information about this technology.

Discussion
Skilled nursing facilities and home health agencies receive no incentives for adoption of electronic health record systems and are not commonly included in HIEs. These organizations do, however collect extensive structured data about their patients (Minimum Data Set for nursing facilities, Outcome and Assessment Information Set for home health agencies) and transmit the data electronically to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). A tool is now available that will intercept the transmissions to CMS, transform content extracted from patient assessments into CCDs, and send the CCDs to a designated HIE.

Conclusion
Responding HIEs reported almost no experience exchanging patient assessment information from LTPAC providers. Anticipated benefits include safer care transitions; anticipated barriers include information technology constraints in LTPAC settings.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Consumer health IT applications have the potential to improve quality, safety and efficiency of consumers' interactions with the healthcare system. Yet little attention has been paid to human factors and ergonomics in the design of consumer health IT, potentially limiting the ability of health IT to achieve these goals. This paper presents the results of an analysis of human factors and ergonomics issues encountered by five projects during the design and implementation of home-based consumer health IT applications.
METHODS: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality-funded consumer health IT research projects, where patients used the IT applications in their homes, were reviewed. Project documents and discussions with project teams were analysed to identify human factors and ergonomic issues considered or addressed by project teams. The analysis focused on system design and design processes used as well as training, implementation and use of the IT intervention.
RESULTS: A broad range of consumer health IT applications and diverse set of human factors and ergonomics issues were identified. The design and implementation processes used resulted in poor fit with some patients' healthcare tasks and the home environment and, in some cases, resulted in lack of use. Clinician interaction with patients and the information provided through health IT applications appeared to positively influence adoption and use.
CONCLUSIONS: Consumer health IT application design would benefit from the use of human factors and ergonomics design and evaluation methods. Considering the context in which home-based consumer health IT applications are used will likely affect the ability of these applications to positively impact the quality, safety and efficiency of patient care.},

	abstract = {Purpose of the Study: Falls are a major problem for the elderly people leading to injury, disability, and even death. An unobtrusive, in-home sensor system that continuously monitors older adults for fall risk and detects falls could revolutionize fall prevention and care.
Design and Methods: A fall risk and detection system was developed and installed in the apartments of 19 older adults at a senior living facility. The system includes pulse-Doppler radar, a Microsoft Kinect, and 2 web cameras. To collect data for comparison with sensor data and for algorithm development, stunt actors performed falls in participants’ apartments each month for 2 years and participants completed fall risk assessments (FRAs) using clinically valid, standardized instruments. The FRAs were scored by clinicians and recorded by the sensing modalities. Participants’ gait parameters were measured as they walked on a GAITRite mat. These data were used as ground truth, objective data to use in algorithm development and to compare with radar and Kinect generated variables.
Results: All FRAs are highly correlated (p {\textless} .01) with the Kinect gait velocity and Kinect stride length. Radar velocity is correlated (p {\textless} .05) to all the FRAs and highly correlated (p {\textless} .01) to most. Real-time alerts of actual falls are being sent to clinicians providing faster responses to urgent situations.
Implications: The in-home FRA and detection system has the potential to help older adults remain independent, maintain functional ability, and live at home longer.},

	abstract = {Background
Length of stay at US acute care hospitals has been steadily decreasing since 1960, and there is ongoing concern that increasing financial pressures on hospitals with high proportions of Medicaid patients may be causing unduly short lengths of stay.

Objective
To study temporal trends in hospital utilization on internal medicine services at Temple University Hospital, which has the highest percentage of Medicaid and uninsured patients in the state of Pennsylvania.

Design
Examination of temporal changes in hospital practice over three time periods spanning 13 years.

Measurements
Numbers of discharges, 1- and 12-month re-admission rates, and lengths of stay. US census data from 1990 to 2000 were examined for the eight major zip codes in which hospitalized patients live.

Main Results
The number of internal medicine admissions increased from 1991 (117/month) to 2004 (455/month); p {\textless} 0.0001. Mean length of stay for the index admission decreased from 8.7 to 4.9 days; p {\textless} 0.001. The percentage of patients readmitted within 12 months of the discharge date of the index admission increased from 42.3\% to 49.5\%; p = 0.045. Mean cumulative length of stay over 12 months, including readmissions, decreased significantly (15.8 to 12.5 days; p = 0.031). Compared to all US hospitals, our hospital had a greater increase in admissions and a greater decrease in length of stay. During this time period, in surrounding zip codes, there were decreases in total population and total number of persons living in poverty, but also multiple closures of area hospitals that served poor patients.

Conclusion
During the 13-year study period, despite increased readmission rates, the overall number of hospitalized days per year on the internal medicine inpatient service decreased. As local hospitals serving this inner city low income area have closed, our hospital had atypically high increases in numbers of admissions and decreases in length of stay. This raises questions about current adequacy of hospital care in inner city areas of poverty.},

Cohort: 51,619 people aged 65 years or older at the time of the 2001 Census and not living in a care home, drawn from a data linkage study based on c.28\% of the Northern Ireland population.

Living alone was less common in rural areas; 25\% of older people in rural areas lived with children compared to 18\% in urban areas. Care home admission was more common in urban (4.7\%) and intermediate (4.3\%) areas than in rural areas (3.2\%). Even after adjusting for age, sex, health and living arrangements, the rate of care home admission in rural areas was still only 75\% of that in urban areas.

People in rural areas experience better family support by living as part of two or three generation households. Even after accounting for this difference, older rural dwellers are less likely to enter care homes; suggesting that neighbours and relatives in rural areas provide more informal care; or that there may be differential deployment of formal home care services.},

These policy reforms include a new payment system, eligibility restrictions, and stringent fraud and abuse enforcement. In addition, Medicare now pays for home health care based on the location of the beneficiary, not the agency. To examine the impact of these changes on access to care, we evaluated the degree to which beneficiaries are served by agencies outside of their county. We constructed an analytical file by linking the 1997 five percent Medicare Standard Analytical File home health claims file to the Provider of Services file to obtain the characteristics of the beneficiaries' primary agency. This beneficiary-level analytical file included information on 162,241 Medicare home health users - including 43,488 rural residents - of 9,410 home health agencies. We examined the characteristics of rural beneficiaries served by urban agencies as compared with those served by rural agencies. Our findings demonstrate that urban agencies - either directly or through their branch offices - play an important role in providing home health care to rural Medicare beneficiaries.},

	abstract = {Background
We examined formal home care utilization among civilian adults across metro and nonmetro residential categories before and after adjustment for predisposing, enabling, and need variables.

Methods
Two years of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) were combined to produce a nationally representative sample of adults who resided in the community for a calendar year. We established 6 rural–urban categories based upon Urban Influence Codes and examined 2 dependent variables: (a) likelihood of using any formal home care and (b) number of provider days received by users. The Area Resource File provided county-level information. Logistic and negative binomial regression analyses were employed, with adjustments for the MEPS complex sampling design and the combined years.

Results
Under controls for predisposing, enabling, and need variables, differences in likelihood of any formal home care use disappear, but differences in number of provider days received by users emerged, with fewer provider days in remote areas than in metro and several other nonmetro types.

Conclusions
It is important to fully account for predisposing, enabling, and need factors when assessing rural and urban home care utilization patterns. The limited provider days in remote counties under controls suggest a possible access problem for adults in these areas.},

The National Association for Home Care continuously keeps rural access on the radar and supports legislation that will preserve home care access to vulnerable rural areas. Of special interest are the rural elderly. Rural residents older than the age of 65 years represent a large portion of the nation’s home care recipients. Although people older than 65 years are living longer, healthier lives, they frequently require quality health care to make that possible. This population is also more likely to have complex medical issues requiring health care interventions. A review of current literature shows that there are many emerging trends posing a significant risk to the future of home care in rural America.

A stratified random sample was selected from a database of risk-adjusted publicly reported patient outcomes from Medicare-certified home health care agencies and merged with agency factors from Medicare cost reports and U.S. Census data. Path analysis was performed to evaluate the relationships in the model. Hospitalization is the only outcome variable associated with community and agency characteristics or home health care use. Rurality does not have a direct effect on hospitalization; however, increased visits per patient and low-income community status are associated with increased hospitalization. Rurality may not have a direct effect on outcomes but instead acts through health care services.},

Hospitalization was measured using Medicare claims data; risk factors were measured using Outcome Assessment and Information Set data. Seventeen percent of sample members were hospitalized. Multivariate logistic regression analysis found that the most influential risk factors (all p {\textless} .001) were skin wound as primary HHC diagnosis, clinician-judged guarded rehabilitation prognosis, congestive heart failure as primary HHC diagnosis, presence of depressive symptoms, dyspnea severity, and Black, compared to White. HHC initiatives that minimize chronic condition exacerbations and actively treat depressive symptoms might help reduce Medicare patient hospitalizations. Unmeasured reasons for higher hospitalization rates among Black HHC patients deserve further investigation.},

When measured as adverse events, rural and urban differences were not significant. Even though results were statistically significant, this does not imply that they were important or clinically meaningful; rather, results suggest that rural and urban agencies' performance on the set of outcomes measured in this study is relatively comparable. This is an encouraging result given concerns that access to skilled providers (e.g., occupational therapists) is limited in many rural communities.

The National Long Term Care Survey (NLTCS) was used to explore the relationship between residential setting and subsequent noninstitutional services utilization. Weighted logistic regression procedures for complex survey designs were used to guide the analysis. Living in the Northeast and residence in moderately densely populated areas (towns, small cities, and suburbs) were significant positive predictors of subsequent medical, home-, and community-based services utilization. Because some differentials were found in access to and use of services by regional and geographic setting, policy-makers need to develop alternative strategies to eliminate inequities in the distribution of noninstitutional long-term care services in more remote areas.},

To advance the creation of a nationwide health information technology infrastructure, federal and state policy makers should consider additional measures, such as adopting health information technology standards and EHR system certification criteria appropriate for these ineligible hospitals; including such hospitals in state health information exchange programs; and establishing low-interest loan programs for the acquisition and use of certified EHR systems by ineligible providers.},

	abstract = {Workflow, loosely defined, is the set of tasks—grouped chronologically into processes—and the set of people or resources needed for those tasks, that are necessary to accomplish a given goal. An organization’s workflow is comprised of the set of processes it needs to accomplish, the set of people or other resources available to perform those processes, and the interactions among them. Consider the following scenario: These same methods that an organization uses to get work done, however, can begin to show stress under trying circumstances. When the ward is full and it takes 12 hours for a room to be readied for the next patient, that impact is felt throughout the organization. When the number of small interruptions outweighs the amount of planned work done in a given hour, that impact is felt in slower progress, lower job satisfaction, and potentially lower quality of care. In many situations, it is very clear to all what needs to get done. Where organizations differ is in how they do it. The examination of how an organization accomplishes its tasks often concerns the organizations’ workflow. In health care, as in other industries, some workflows are designed, while others arise organically and evolve. The systems and methods by which organizations accomplish specific goals differ dramatically. Some organizational workflows seem more straightforward than others. Most often, when workflow processes are looked at in isolation, the processes appear quite logical (and even efficient) in acting to accomplish the end goal. It is in the interaction among the processes that complexities arise. Some of these interactions hide conflicts in the priorities of different roles in an organization, for example, what the nursing team is accountable to versus the physician team and its schedule. Organizations also adapt workflows to suit the evolving environment. Over time, reflecting on organizational workflows may show that some processes are no longer necessary, or can be updated and optimized.},

	abstract = {Agile manufacturing, fast-response micromarketing, and the rise of the virtual organization have led managers to focus on cross-functional business processes that link various divisions and organizations. These processes may be realized as one or more workflows, each of which is an instantiation of a process under certain conditions. Because an ability to adapt processes to workflow conditions is essential for organizational responsiveness, identifying and analyzing significant workflows is an important activity for managers, organization designers, and information systems specialists. A variety of software systems have been developed to aid in the structuring and implementation of workflow systems, but they are mostly visualization tools with few analytical capabilities. For example, they do not allow their users to easily determine which information elements are needed to compute other information elements, whether certain tasks depend on other tasks, and how resource availability affects information and tasks. Analyses of this type can be performed by inspection, but this gives rise to the possibility of error, especially in large systems. In this paper, we show how a mathematical construct called a metagraph can be used to represent workflows, so that such questions can be addressed through formal operations, leading to more effective design of organizational processes.},

ISTA captures common types of interaction with special emphasis on recursive processes, i.e., feedback loops that alter the newly introduced HIT and promote second-level changes in the social system. ISTA draws on prior studies of unintended consequences, along with research in sociotechnical systems, ergonomics, social informatics, technology-in-practice, and social construction of technology. We present five types of sociotechnical interaction and illustrate each with cases from published research. The ISTA model should further research on emergent and recursive processes in HIT implementation and their unintended consequences.

OBJECTIVE: To describe and examine VHA's experience disseminating PACT transformation using a Breakthrough Series Collaborative method. DESIGN: Observational study.

KEY RESULTS: A majority of the participants indicated that the PACT Collaborative was necessary to implement PACT. The number of PDSAs increased steadily during the Collaborative period; 93 \% (n = 1,547) of PDSAs were successfully implemented.

This positive impact may be due to the spread of the PACT Model through the PACT Collaborative, among other learning initiatives. CONCLUSIONS: For complex collaborative models such as PACT, more than three learning sessions may be required. As VHA continues to disseminate the PACT Model through primary care, into specialty/surgical care and beyond, the Collaborative Learning Model may continue to be an effective way to leverage a small number of faculty, coaches, and industrial engineers across an extremely large population.},

A total of 40 patients, 35 informal caregivers, and 15 clinicians participated in this study. Patients recalled receiving discharge instructions but with few details and limited information about follow-up actions if they had problems. Discharge instructions were a versatile means of communication. Home health clinicians used these instructions to guide discussions with patients and their caregivers.

	abstract = {Objective
To understand home-care nurses‘ perceptions of the post-hospitalization information needs and communication problems of elderly patients, and how these factors might contribute to undesirable outcomes including poor patient reintegration into prior living environments and unplanned hospital readmissions.

Design
A ranked list of information needs experienced by patients was developed by two Nominal Group Technique (NGT) sessions from the perspective of home-care nurses. The list was combined with results from previously published work to develop a web-based survey administered to home care nurses‘ to elicit perceptions of patients‘ post-hospitalization information needs.

Results
Seventeen nurses participated in the NGT sessions, producing a list of 28 challenges grouped into five themes: medications, disease/condition, discharge, non-medication care, and functional limitations, and communication problems. The survey was sent to 220 home-care nurses, with a 54.1\% (119/220) response rate. Respondents identified several frequent, high-impact information and communication needs that have received little attention in readmission literature, including information about medication regimens; the severity of their condition; hospital discharge management process; non-medication care regimens such as wound care, use of durable medical equipment and home safety; the extent of care needed, and which providers are best suited to provide that care. Responses also identified several communication difficulties that may play a role in readmissions.

Conclusions
Information needs and communication problems identified by home-care nurses expanded upon and reinforced results from prior studies. These results might be used to develop interventions that may improve information sharing among clinicians, patients, and caregivers during care transitions to ensure patient reintegration into prior living environments, potentially preventing unplanned hospital readmissions.},

	abstract = {Background
Older people have higher rates of hospital admission than the general population and higher rates of readmission due to complications and falls. During hospitalisation, older people experience significant functional decline which impairs their future independence and quality of life. Acute hospital services comprise the largest section of health expenditure in Australia and prevention or delay of disease is known to produce more effective use of services. Current models of discharge planning and follow-up care, however, do not address the need to prevent deconditioning or functional decline. This paper describes the protocol of a randomised controlled trial which aims to evaluate innovative transitional care strategies to reduce unplanned readmissions and improve functional status, independence, and psycho-social well-being of community-based older people at risk of readmission.

Methods/Design
The study is a randomised controlled trial. Within 72 hours of hospital admission, a sample of older adults fitting the inclusion/exclusion criteria (aged 65 years and over, admitted with a medical diagnosis, able to walk independently for 3 meters, and at least one risk factor for readmission) are randomised into one of four groups: 1) the usual care control group, 2) the exercise and in-home/telephone follow-up intervention group, 3) the exercise only intervention group, or 4) the in-home/telephone follow-up only intervention group. The usual care control group receive usual discharge planning provided by the health service. In addition to usual care, the exercise and in-home/telephone follow-up intervention group receive an intervention consisting of a tailored exercise program, in-home visit and 24 week telephone follow-up by a gerontic nurse. The exercise only and in-home/telephone follow-up only intervention groups, in addition to usual care receive only the exercise or gerontic nurse components of the intervention respectively. Data collection is undertaken at baseline within 72 hours of hospital admission, 4 weeks following hospital discharge, 12 weeks following hospital discharge, and 24 weeks following hospital discharge. Outcome assessors are blinded to group allocation. Primary outcomes are emergency hospital readmissions and health service use, functional status, psychosocial well-being and cost effectiveness.

Discussion
The acute hospital sector comprises the largest component of health care system expenditure in developed countries, and older adults are the most frequent consumers. There are few trials to demonstrate effective models of transitional care to prevent emergency readmissions, loss of functional ability and independence in this population following an acute hospital admission. This study aims to address that gap and provide information for future health service planning which meets client needs and lowers the use of acute care services.

In an ongoing prospective study, nurses’ pre-electronic nursing discharge note and their assessment of the information it was necessary to exchange at the same time was audited and analyzed.

The results show variation in the completeness and content of the nursing discharge note. Nurses’ understanding of the scope and content of information to be transmitted varies widely according to the context and the organizational health care level they work within.

The implementation of an electronic nursing discharge note creates the opportunity to identify the accurate information elements that must be documented and exchanged between the nurses to ensure patient safety and inter-organizational continuity of care.},

	abstract = {Introduction
The successful transfer of an older patient between health care organizations requires open communication between them that details relevant and necessary information about the patient's health status and individual needs. The objective of this study was to identify and describe the process and content of the patient information exchange between nurses in home care and hospital during hospitalization of older home-living patients.

Methods
A multiple case study design was used. Using observations, qualitative interviews and document reviews, the total patient information exchange during each patient's episode of hospitalization (n = 9), from day of admission to return home, was captured.

Results
Information exchange mainly occurred at discharge, including a discharge note sent from hospital to home care, and telephone reports from hospital nurse to home care nurse, and meetings between hospital nurse and patient coordinator from the municipal purchaser unit. No information was provided from the home care nurses to the hospital nurses at admission. Incompleteness in the content of both written and verbal information was found. Information regarding physical care was more frequently reported than other caring dimensions. Descriptions of the patients’ subjective experiences were almost absent and occurred only in the verbal communication.

Conclusions
The gap in the information flow, as well as incompleteness in the content of written and verbal information exchanged, constitutes a challenge to the continuity of care for hospitalized home-living patients. In order to ensure appropriate nursing follow-up care, we emphasize the need for nurses to improve the information flow, as well as to use a more comprehensive approach to older patients, and that this must be reflected in the verbal and written information exchange.},

	abstract = {E-Health alters how health care clinicians, institutions, patients, caregivers, families, advocates, and researchers collaborate. Few guidelines exist to evaluate the impact of social technologies on furthering family health and even less on their capacity to ameliorate health disparities. Health social media tools that help develop, sustain, and strengthen the collaborative health agenda may prove useful to ameliorate health care inequities; the linkage should not, however, be taken for granted. In this article we propose a classification of emerging social technologies in health care with the purpose of developing evaluative criteria that assess their ability to foster collaboration and positively impact health care equity. The findings are based on systematic Internet ethnographic observations, a qualitative analysis of e-health tool exemplars, and a review of the literature. To triangulate data collection and analysis, the research team consulted with social media health care experts in making recommendations for evaluation criteria. Selected cases illustrate the analytical conclusions. Lines of research that are needed to accurately rate and reliably measure the ability of social media e-health offerings to address health disparities are proposed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Observations made by the investigator as part of a larger study suggested that the intricacy and breadth of nursing knowledge and actions that were actually used far exceeded what the standard documentation recorded. Spradley's Developmental Research Sequence, combining methods of participant observation and interviewing, was used to answer the question: What nursing strategies are used in managing the health needs of HIV-exposed infants in a home-care programme? Thematic analyses revealed that the visit process had four essential elements, as perceived and lived by the nurses: the pursuit; the connection; the work; and the disengagement. This full scope of nursing strategies for assisting and empowering these families remains largely invisible, limited to verbal transmission to family caregivers and among nurses. It needs to be documented, claimed and further studied by nursing. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although there is a developing body of literature dealing with cultural care issues there is a continuing need for research based knowledge of how nurses work within a multicultural population in providing culturally competent care. Nurses' experiences with Vietnamese clients can contribute to the knowledge of how to provide cultural care. PURPOSE: The purpose of this 1997 study was to investigate what North American nurses learned from their work with Vietnamese clients. METHOD: A grounded theory approach was employed. A purposive sample of 27 Registered Nurses, who work with Vietnamese clients in North America, in acute care, community, and clinic settings were interviewed using a semi-structured format. Following ethical approval, an explanation of the study, and data collection, data were analysed using dimensional analysis. Verifiability, adequacy of the findings, and empirical grounding of the theory was established through use of the constant comparative method as well as review of the research method and the study results by selected participants in the study and a nursing expert. FINDINGS: The action process of cultural discovery was found as the most fruitful explanation of nurses' experiences. Properties of cultural discovery were learning to see them, seeing a common humanity, and learning to see how they see health. The condition of cultural discovery was making a connection with the consequences of learning how to provide sensitive care and a changed nurse. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses can learn to become more culturally competent in their care for Vietnamese clients. Nurses learned to be more aware of the differences among people of different cultures as well as recognizing common elements among different groups. They learned to broaden and redevelop their concept of health and to respect the social adjustments that the Vietnamese were making.},

Clients from minority ethnic groups continue to experience inequalities in health status and care provision. District nurses work with a wide range of clients, yet research has demonstrated inequities in service provision to clients from minority ethnic groups due to organizational, professional and personal constraints. Methods. A qualitative methodology was used to explore district nurses' understanding of discrimination and equalities issues in the context of their work. Semistructured interviews were undertaken during 2003 with 18 district nurses employed in two primary care organizations in England providing healthcare services to a large and culturally diverse population. Findings. District nurses' accounts were marked by uncertainty, suggesting that many lacked confidence when discussing issues of ethnicity and cultural difference. There were marked differences in the extent to which they appeared to recognize or engage with clients' experiences of discrimination or inequalities, or to recognize inequitable service provision to clients from minority ethnic groups. Key issues were a lack of provision of district nursing services to some clients, and failures to meet clients' language and communication needs, and although reflecting organizational constraints, such continuing inequities were largely unquestioned. Conclusion. There is a need for further educational and practice developments to enable district nurses to provide more equitable care to clients from culturally diverse communities, ensuring that the key professional discourse of individual care and advocacy are fully realized in their work with all clients.},

Contradictions developed from diversities of perspectives incorporated in this particular multicultural area. Nurses saw themselves as mediators and allowed complexity to be considered in order to manage care. They took on responsibility of creating a 'space of care', while the organizational structures of home care were perceived as something outside the care praxis.

	abstract = {Objective
To describe and discuss the process used to write a narrative review of the literature for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Publication of narrative overviews of the literature should be standardized to increase their objectivity.
Background
In the past decade numerous changes in research methodology pertaining to reviews of the literature have occurred. These changes necessitate authors of review articles to be familiar with current standards in the publication process.
Methods
Narrative overview of the literature synthesizing the findings of literature retrieved from searches of computerized databases, hand searches, and authoritative texts.
Discussion
An overview of the use of three types of reviews of the literature is presented. Step by step instructions for how to conduct and write a narrative overview utilizing a ‘best-evidence synthesis’ approach are discussed, starting with appropriate preparatory work and ending with how to create proper illustrations. Several resources for creating reviews of the literature are presented and a narrative overview critical appraisal worksheet is included. A bibliography of other useful reading is presented in an appendix.
Conclusion
Narrative overviews can be a valuable contribution to the literature if prepared properly. New and experienced authors wishing to write a narrative overview should find this article useful in constructing such a paper and carrying out the research process. It is hoped that this article will stimulate scholarly dialog amongst colleagues about this research design and other complex literature review methods.},

This study reports on the process of developing and implementing a culturally adapted treatment for promoting parent involvement by Latino parents in Head Start preschool programs and examines engagement factors affecting participation in the treatment. Results show that Latino parents with higher native cultural competence perceived more benefits to the treatment and reported fewer barriers than parents with lower native cultural competence. Also, the total number of barriers to participation that parents perceived before treatment was negatively associated with treatment participation, above and beyond the influence of acculturation factors, parent perceptions of economic stress, and perceived program benefits. Results are discussed in terms of how to establish effective community-based mental health and educational outreach programs to promote engagement with Latino families. The importance of using bidimensional models of acculturation within research designs with Latino populations and ideas for future research are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

	abstract = {Background Cultural competency is a recognized and popular approach to improving the provision of health care to racial/ethnic minority groups in the community with the aim of reducing racial/ethnic health disparities. The aim of this systematic review of reviews is to gather and synthesize existing reviews of studies in the field to form a comprehensive understanding of the current evidence base that can guide future interventions and research in the area. Methods A systematic review of review articles published between January 2000 and June 2012 was conducted. Electronic databases (including Medline, Cinahl and PsycINFO), reference lists of articles, and key websites were searched. Reviews of cultural competency in health settings only were included. Each review was critically appraised by two authors using a study appraisal tool and were given a quality assessment rating of weak, moderate or strong. Results Nineteen published reviews were identified. Reviews consisted of between 5 and 38 studies, included a variety of health care settings/contexts and a range of study types. There were three main categories of study outcomes: patient-related outcomes, provider-related outcomes, and health service access and utilization outcomes. The majority of reviews found moderate evidence of improvement in provider outcomes and health care access and utilization outcomes but weaker evidence for improvements in patient/client outcomes. Conclusion This review of reviews indicates that there is some evidence that interventions to improve cultural competency can improve patient/client health outcomes. However, a lack of methodological rigor is common amongst the studies included in reviews and many of the studies rely on self-report, which is subject to a range of biases, while objective evidence of intervention effectiveness was rare. Future research should measure both healthcare provider and patient/client health outcomes, consider organizational factors, and utilize more rigorous study designs. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Sample: A convenience sample of 31 PHNs participated. Measurements: Participants completed the Cultural Competence Assessment tool and documented personal experiences and perceptions of culturally competent health care through open-ended questions. Results: Most participants reported a moderate level of cultural competence. Cultural awareness and sensitivity scores were higher than scores for culturally competent behaviors. Participation in specific types of cultural competence training was significantly related to higher scores on cultural competence. Participants documented culturally competent care for a diverse clientele and requested additional diversity educational opportunities and interpreter services. Conclusions: The nurses had culturally competent knowledge and attitudes but were unable to fully and consistently enact these in practice. The need for appropriate cultural competence education and interpreter services addressing health disparities, as mandated in the Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services in Health Care standards, is emphasized.

Journal of Advanced Nursing 68(3), 695-704. Abstract Aim.  This paper presents a discussion of the relation between health literacy and cultural competence in nursing practice. Background.  Cultural competence involves understanding values, beliefs, traditions and customs of diverse groups. Health literacy is the degree to which individuals can obtain, process, and understand health information to make healthcare decisions. Cultural competence and health literacy are directly related to healthcare. Campinha-Bacote's Process of Cultural Competence Model can assist nurses in addressing cultural issues associated with a person's low health literacy. Data sources.  Literature searches were performed using CINAHL, ERIC, Academic Search Premier, Health Source Nursing, MasterFILE Premier and Academic OneFile. All articles reviewed were published in peer reviewed journals in English from the 1990s to the present and were relevant to health literacy and cultural competence in nursing. Books and other supporting scholarly sources were also used. Discussion.  Health literacy and cultural competence are related. Applying Campinha-Bacote's Process of Cultural Competence Model using the mnemonic ASKED (awareness, skills, knowledge, encounters and desire) involves incorporating culturally appropriate assessments and disseminating healthcare information at lower literacy levels and is needed for nurses to provide care for ethnic minorities and diverse populations. Implications for nursing.  Health literacy should be assessed and care should be based on a client's level of understanding and cultural values and norms. Conclusion.  Nurses can care for ethnic minorities by using resources that target health literacy deficits and by increasing their own cultural competence. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

	abstract = {Aim To explore home-care nurses' experiences of patient safety in their delivery of home care to older clients. Background High-risk organisations, such as the airline industry and the petroleum industry, have long been preoccupied with safety. Only recently has this also become a central theme in health care. Method Four focus group interviews with 20 nurses who work in home care. A qualitative thematic analysis was performed. Results One main theme was identified: struggling with responsibility in different situations. It comprises five subthemes: poor work morale and work ethic; documentation; lack of functional leadership; competence; and lack of updated routines and guidelines. Conclusions Patient safety culture is compromised by a lack of leadership, lack of responsibility among leadership, lack of routines, failure to update procedures, and a lack of knowledge and education among health-care workers. Implications for nursing management Nurse managers need to be made more aware of the dilemmas faced by nurses, how they struggle with their responsibilities, how they experience powerlessness in certain situations, and the lack of support they receive in decision-making.},

The purpose of this study was to test using cafecitos and telenovelas to affect MA elders’ and caregivers’ attitudes toward use of HCS. Cafecitos are traditional informal discussions among similar people. Discussions about attitudes toward using HCS were tested with 3 samples in 3 settings at local and neighborhood associations (n = 43). Telenovelas are dramatizations of compelling stories in Spanish. These were tested with 4 samples in 4 settings (n = 55). Todo ha cambiado portrayed the story of an older MA woman who grappled with her attitudes toward using HCS. Themes of the cafecitos indicated that participation increased knowledge that HCS existed. Anecdotal comments revealed that the participants identified with the Telenovela story. Although the pilot sample was too small to derive statistical significance, comparisons of pre- and posttests showed a trend toward increased knowledge. Cafecitos and telenovelas are promising, culturally competent strategies for increasing MA elders’ and caregivers’ knowledge and willingness to consider using HCS.},

Can Medicare succeed with accountable care organizations if physicians can’t determine whether patients are in the organization or not? Will commercial hospitals use their clout to create accountable care organizations, leaving physician practices in a weaker position?

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Describe the characteristics of hospitalized older adults who were not referred for home care, compare the referral decisions of hospital clinicians with those of nurses with expertise in discharge planning and transitional care, and compare the characteristics of hospitalized older adults who did not receive a home care referral with patients who did receive a home care referral.
DESIGN: Secondary analysis, descriptive, case series.
SETTING: Subjects were discharged to home from one of two urban hospitals in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-nine patients for this study were drawn from the control group (n = 186) of a prior randomized clinical trial of advanced practice nurse hospital discharge planning and home follow-up. These 99 patients, or 56 of the control group, did not receive a home care referral even though they were screened into the original study as meeting at least one of the risk criteria associated with poor postdischarge outcomes.
MEASUREMENTS: Case studies were generated from research records of the control group patients who did not receive a home care referral. They included patient sociodemographic and health characteristics. Nurses with expertise in discharge planning and transitional care, blinded to the actual decision, reviewed each case study and made a referral decision.
RESULTS: Case studies revealed that control group patients, discharged without home follow-up, had many characteristics associated with the need for a home care referral, with the likelihood of receiving a referral, or with developing poor postdischarge outcomes. Overall, compared with control group patients who did not receive home care, those who did were older, had a longer hospital stay, more often rated their health as fair or poor, and had worse functional status. However, transitional care nurses judged that 96 of 99 of the control group patients discharged without home care had unmet discharge needs that may have benefited from a postdischarge referral. In addition, the transitional care nurses identified 49 of these 99 patients as having a high-priority need for home care. These patients had at least three of the characteristics associated with the need for a home care referral, the likelihood of receiving a referral, or of developing poor postdischarge outcomes. High-priority patients were significantly different in many sociodemographic and health characteristics and were rehospitalized significantly more often than other control group patients who were discharged without home care (P = .032).
CONCLUSION: Study findings have demonstrated that the majority of older adults in this sample were discharged without postdischarge referrals despite the presence of several characteristics associated with the need for home care and risk of poor discharge outcomes. Findings suggest the need for improved methods to identify and synthesize patient characteristics associated with the need for postdischarge referral and to support clinical decision-making. Insurance or homebound status should also be explored as barriers to patients receiving the postdischarge care that they need.},

	abstract = {Objective
To report on the results of a review concerning the use of mobile phones for health with older adults.
Methods
PubMed and CINAHL were searched for articles using “older adults” and “mobile phones” along with related terms and synonyms between 1965 and June 2012. Identified articles were filtered by the following inclusion criteria: original research project utilizing a mobile phone as an intervention, involve/target adults 60 years of age or older, and have an aim emphasizing the mobile phone’s use in health.
Results
Twenty-one different articles were found and categorized into ten different clinical domains, including diabetes, activities of daily life, and dementia care, among others. The largest group of articles focused on diabetes care (4 articles), followed by COPD (3 articles), Alzheimer’s/dementia Care (3 articles) and osteoarthritis (3 articles). Areas of interest studied included feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness. While there were many different clinical domains, the majority of studies were pilot studies that needed more work to establish a stronger base of evidence.
Conclusions
Current work in using mobile phones for older adult use are spread across a variety of clinical domains. While this work is promising, current studies are generally smaller feasibility studies, and thus future work is needed to establish more generalizable, stronger base of evidence for effectiveness of these interventions.},

This widening of disparities in American culture is likely to worsen over the coming years due, in part, to our increasing reliance on Internet-based technologies to disseminate health information and services. The purpose of the current article is to incorporate health literacy into an Integrative Model of eHealth Use. We argue for this theoretical understanding of eHealth literacy and propose that macro-level disparities in social structures are connected to health disparities through the micro-level conduits of eHealth literacy, motivation, and ability. In other words, structural inequities reinforce themselves and continue to contribute to healthcare disparities through the differential distribution of technologies that simultaneously enhance and impede literacy, motivation, and ability of different groups (and individuals) in the population. We conclude the article by suggesting pragmatic implications of our analysis.},

	abstract = {Health disparities are a persistent problem worldwide. A major obstacle to reducing health disparities is reliance on "consumable interventions," that is, interventions that, once used, cannot be used again. To reduce health disparities, interventions are required that can be used again and again without losing their therapeutic power, that can reach people even if local health care systems do not provide them with needed health care, and that can be shared globally without taking resources away from the populations where the interventions were developed. This paper presents the argument that automated self-help evidence-based Internet interventions meet the above criteria and can contribute to the reduction of health disparities worldwide. Proof-of-concept studies show that evidence-based Internet interventions can reach hundreds of thousands of people worldwide and could be used in public sector settings to augment existing offerings and provide services not currently available (such as prevention interventions). This paper presents a framework for systematically filling in a matrix composed of columns representing common health problems and rows representing languages. To bring the benefits of evidence-based Internet interventions to the underserved, public sector clinics should establish eHealth resource centers, through which patients could be screened online for common disorders and provided with evidence-based Internet intervention services not currently available at the clinics. These resources should be available in the patients' languages, in formats that do not require literacy, and that can be accessed with mobile devices. Such evidence-based Internet interventions should then be shared with public sector clinics as well as individuals anywhere in the world. Finally, this paper addresses sustainability and describes a continuum of evidence-based Internet interventions to share nationally and across the world. This approach to expanding health service delivery will significantly contribute to a reduction of health disparities worldwide, adding to the often-quoted slogan, "Think globally, act locally," a third line: "Share globally."},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low health literacy has been identified as an independent predictor of poor asthma control. The Institute of Medicine considers the role of information technology (IT) as critical in providing "safe, effective, patient centered, timely, efficient, and equitable" care with the potential to reduce health disparities in underserved populations. The aim of this study was to design and evaluate an interactive computer-based questionnaire to assess asthma symptoms in children of parents with limited health literacy and/or limited English proficiency.
METHODS: Volunteer caregivers attending a mobile asthma clinic were randomly assigned to complete the electronic or the paper-and-pencil version of an asthma screening questionnaire (ASQ) in their language of choice (English or Spanish). In the electronic version, a tablet computer was used to present the ASQ questions as video clips and to collect information through the touchscreen. Participants also completed a demographic questionnaire, a brief health literacy questionnaire, and a system usability and satisfaction questionnaire. Reliability of the paper and electronic self-assessments was evaluated by comparing each participant's answers to information they provided during a nurse-guided structured interview (gold standard).
RESULTS: A total of 48 parents participated in the study, 26 completed the electronic ASQ and 21 the paper-and-pencil form. Thirty-five percent of the children had well-controlled asthma (n = 17). Most participants were Spanish speaking (67\%) Hispanic (n = 44) mothers (n = 43) with a median age of 32 years. More than half had ≤8 years of education (n = 25) and earned {\textless}\$20,000 per year (n = 27). The median health literacy score was 32 (range 0-36). The correlation between health literacy scores and years of education was significant (ρ = .47, p {\textless} .01). Concordance between the electronic ASQ and the nurse interview was significantly higher than concordance between the paper ASQ and the nurse interview (68\% versus 54\%; p {\textless} .01). All parents who completed the electronic questionnaire reported being satisfied; 96\% felt comfortable using it, and found it simple to use.
CONCLUSIONS: By facilitating the assessment of asthma symptoms at manageable cost, interactive information technology tools may help reduce barriers to access due to inadequate levels of English proficiency and health literacy.},

	abstract = {Background
 Electronic personal health records (PHRs) are increasingly recognized and used as a tool to address various challenges stemming from the scattered and incompatible personal health information that exists in the contemporary US health care system. Although activity around PHR development and deployment has increased in recent years, little has been reported regarding the use and utility of PHRs among low-income and/or elderly populations.

Objective
 The aim was to assess the use and utility of PHRs in a low-income, elderly population.

Methods
 We deployed a Web-based, institution-neutral PHR system, the Personal Health Information Management System (PHIMS), in a federally funded housing facility for low-income and elderly residents. We assessed use and user satisfaction through system logs, questionnaire surveys, and user group meetings.

Results
 Over the 33-month study period, 70 residents participated; this number was reduced to 44 by the end of the study. Although the PHIMS was available for free and personal assistance and computers with Internet connection were provided without any cost to residents, only 13\% (44/330) of the eligible residents used the system, and system usage was limited. Almost one half of the users (47\%, 33/70) used the PHIMS only on a single day. Use was also highly correlated with the availability of in-person assistance; 77\% of user activities occurred while the assistance was available. Residents’ ability to use the PHR system was limited by poor computer and Internet skills, technophobia, low health literacy, and limited physical/cognitive abilities. Among the 44 PHIMS users, 14 (32\%) responded to the questionnaire. In this selected subgroup of survey participants, the majority (82\%, 9/11) used the PHIMS three times or more and reported that it improved the quality of overall health care they received.

Conclusions
 Our findings suggest that those who can benefit the most from a PHR system may be the least able to use it. Disparities in access to and use of computers, the Internet, and PHRs may exacerbate health care inequality in the future.},

In this article we propose a classification of emerging social technologies in health care with the purpose of developing evaluative criteria that assess their ability to foster collaboration and positively impact health care equity. The findings are based on systematic Internet ethnographic observations, a qualitative analysis of e-health tool exemplars, and a review of the literature. To triangulate data collection and analysis, the research team consulted with social media health care experts in making recommendations for evaluation criteria.

This health communication project measured the psychosocial influences of computer anxiety, computer confidence, and computer self-efficacy in older adults at six meal congregate sites. The adults completed a five-week education intervention, based on Bandura's self-efficacy model, designed to assist older adults in retrieving and evaluating health information resources on the Internet.

Methods:
One hundred thirty-seven participants, ages sixty-five and older, were randomized in a controlled, two-group, pre–post, repeated measures design. Participants in the intervention group received a two-hour training session, once a week for five weeks. The Computer Confidence Subscale and Computer Anxiety Subscale of the Computer Attitude Scale and the Computer Self-Efficacy Measure were administered to both groups at three time intervals: at baseline, completion of the five-week intervention, and six weeks after completion of the intervention. Data were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance.

Results:
Findings showed a reduction in computer anxiety and increases in computer confidence and computer self-efficacy in retrieving and evaluating online health information (P{\textless}0.001).

Discussion:
The study suggests an array of possibilities to engage older adults in the use of Internet health information resources to better contribute to their health, independence, safety, and wellness.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Public engagement with eHealth is generally viewed as beneficial. However, despite the potential benefits, public engagement with eHealth services remains variable. This article explores reasons for this variability through a review of published international literature.
Methods
A focused search, conducted in January 2009, of three bibliographic databases, MEDLINE, CINAHL and EMBASE, returned 2622 unique abstracts.
Results
Fifty articles met the inclusion criteria for the review. Four main types of eHealth service were identified: health information on the Internet; custom-made online health information; online support; and telehealth. Public engagement with these services appears to depend on a number of factors: characteristics of users; technological issues; characteristics of eHealth services; social aspects of use; and eHealth services in use.
Conclusions
Recommendations for policy makers, developers, users and health professionals, include: targeting efforts towards those underserved by eHealth; improving access; tailoring services to meet the needs of a broader range of users; exploiting opportunities for social computing; and clarifying of the role of health professionals in endorsement, promotion and facilitation.},

	shorttitle = {Impact of relational coordination on quality of care, postoperative pain and functioning, and length of stay},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Health care organizations face pressures from patients to improve the quality of care and clinical outcomes, as well as pressures from managed care to do so more efficiently. Coordination, the management of task interdependencies, is one way that health care organizations have attempted to meet these conflicting demands.
OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to introduce the concept of relational coordination and to determine its impact on the quality of care, postoperative pain and functioning, and the length of stay for patients undergoing an elective surgical procedure. Relational coordination comprises frequent, timely, accurate communication, as well as problem-solving, shared goals, shared knowledge, and mutual respect among health care providers.
RESEARCH DESIGN: Relational coordination was measured by a cross-sectional questionnaire of health care providers. Quality of care was measured by a cross-sectional postoperative questionnaire of total hip and knee arthroplasty patients. On the same questionnaire, postoperative pain and functioning were measured by the WOMAC osteoarthritis instrument. Length of stay was measured from individual patient hospital records.
SUBJECTS: The subjects for this study were 338 care providers and 878 patients who completed questionnaires from 9 hospitals in Boston, MA, New York, NY, and Dallas, TX, between July and December 1997.
MEASURES: Quality of care, postoperative pain and functioning, and length of acute hospital stay.
RESULTS: Relational coordination varied significantly between sites, ranging from 3.86 to 4.22 (P {\textless}0.001). Quality of care was significantly improved by relational coordination (P {\textless}0.001) and each of its dimensions. Postoperative pain was significantly reduced by relational coordination (P = 0.041), whereas postoperative functioning was significantly improved by several dimensions of relational coordination, including the frequency of communication (P = 0.044), the strength of shared goals (P = 0.035), and the degree of mutual respect (P = 0.030) among care providers. Length of stay was significantly shortened (53.77\%, P {\textless}0.001) by relational coordination and each of its dimensions.
CONCLUSIONS: Relational coordination across health care providers is associated with improved quality of care, reduced postoperative pain, and decreased lengths of hospital stay for patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty.

In part, this has been attributed to the lack of cultural competence among hospice staff. To assess cultural competence among hospice workers, this article evaluates the results of a descriptive, exploratory survey that was submitted to 125 interdisciplinary hospice employees and completed by 113 of those employees. Cultural-competence behavior scores varied widely based on two factors: increased education and previous cultural-diversity training. The results of this study provide information regarding cultural competence in hospice. In their efforts to provide culturally appropriate end-of-life care, hospices can use the information in this study to implement intervention plans aimed at increasing cultural competence among hospice staff.},

Employing methods of critical ethnography, namely, interviews and participant observation, data were collected from patients, health care providers, administrators and spiritual care providers. The findings revealed the degree to which 'lived religion' was intertwined with 'lived ethics' for many participants; particularly for people from the Sikh faith. For these participants, religion was woven into everyday life, making distinctions between public and private, secular and sacred spaces improbable. Individual interactions, institutional resource allocation, and social discourses are all embedded in social relationships of power that prevent religion from being a solely personal or private matter. Strategies for the reintegration of religion into nursing ethics are: adjusting professional codes and theories of ethics to reflect the influence of religion; and the contribution of critical perspectives, such as postcolonial feminism, to the understanding of lived ethics.},

Recent studies have focused on interventions to address literacy gaps between patients and health care providers, focusing on communication techniques and redefining the responsibility for closing gaps. Cultural differences between patient and provider, if left unaddressed, have been shown to contribute to poor health outcomes through misunderstanding, value conflicts, and disparate concepts of health and illness. The dual challenges of limited health literacy and cultural differences are likely to increase with an expanding, increasingly diverse, and older population. There is evidence that training providers to attend to both issues can reduce medical errors, improve adherence, patient-provider-family communication, and outcomes of care at both individual and population levels. The two fields continue to have separate trajectories, vocabularies, and research agendas, competing for limited curricular resources. This article presents a conceptual framework for health professions education that attends simultaneously to limited health literacy and cultural differences as a coherent way forward in training culturally competent providers with a common skill-set to deliver patient-centered care that focuses on health disparities reduction.},

Purpose: This study evaluated the effect of language barriers on quality of patient care, a resident's ability to learn and teach, and also the effect on length of workday and daily stress. Methods: Data were collected from a 25‐item standardized questionnaire. We used a 5‐point Likert scale ranging from 1 (very significant) to 5 (no influence). Data were cross‐tabulated with biographical attributes of residents and were tested for significance. Results: Language barriers had significant negative impact on quality of patient care, lengthened resident workday (average 52 min), and increased daily stress. With bedside teaching encounters, residents reported compensating by shifting the focus to issues not requiring patient participation. Language barriers had significant negative influence on the resident's ability to role model (i.e., demonstrate for more junior residents) and on the acquisition and practice of good patient‐physician interaction skills. Conclusions: Language barriers significantly impact the daily activity of surgical residents, and we believe that they similarly impact residents in all specialties. All teaching hospitals should have adequate and available medical translators as a tool to bridge the language barrier. Translators should receive specialized training in medical terminology and cultural awareness.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Language barriers between patient and physician impact upon effective health care. This phenomenon is not well studied in the literature.
METHODS: A survey was created in English and Spanish, and administered at the ambulatory site for medical housestaff and faculty at a teaching hospital. "Cases" were defined as patients who reported using a translator or as having poor English skills. Patients who reported not using a translator and having good English skills served as controls. Both groups were predominantly of Hispanic origin.
RESULTS: Analysis revealed 68 cases and 193 controls. The survey completion rate was 96\%. The data were predominantly categorical. Chi-square analysis was utilized. Both groups responded that understanding medication side effects corresponds to compliance (87\% cases vs 93\% controls, p = 0.18). More cases responded that side effects were not explained (47\% vs 16\%, p {\textless} 0.001). More controls reported satisfaction with medical care (93\% vs 84\%, p {\textless} 0.05). More controls agreed that their doctors understood how they were feeling, with statistical significance in Hispanic subset analysis (87\% vs 72\%, p {\textless} 0.05). Both groups felt they had enough time to communicate with their doctors (89\% vs 88\%, p = 0.86). More cases than controls reported having had a mammogram within the last 2 years (78\% vs 60\%, p {\textless} 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Lack of explanation of side effects to medication appeared to correlate negatively with compliance with medication. The language barrier correlated negatively with patient satisfaction. Cases reported more preventive testing; test ordering may replace dialogue.},

Such steps will help promote this bond of trust and aid the nurse in providing more culturally competent care. However, because every person is unique, these same approaches and structured questions can be asked of all patients. To do so will enable the nurse to have a more complete understanding of each patient's health care beliefs, practices, and decision-making strategies. As has been shown through the case studies presented, gaining a more thorough understanding of the patient and his/her family's health care beliefs is critical to achieving cost-effective and clinically positive outcomes.

	doi = {10.1007/s11606-010-1529-0},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cultural competency training has been proposed as a way to improve patient outcomes. There is a need for evidence showing that these interventions reduce health disparities.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to conduct a systematic review addressing the effects of cultural competency training on patient-centered outcomes; assess quality of studies and strength of effect; and propose a framework for future research.
DESIGN: The authors performed electronic searches in the MEDLINE/PubMed, ERIC, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Web of Science databases for original articles published in English between 1990 and 2010, and a bibliographic hand search. Studies that reported cultural competence educational interventions for health professionals and measured impact on patients and/or health care utilization as primary or secondary outcomes were included.
MEASUREMENTS: Four authors independently rated studies for quality using validated criteria and assessed the training effect on patient outcomes. Due to study heterogeneity, data were not pooled; instead, qualitative synthesis and analysis were conducted.
RESULTS: Seven studies met inclusion criteria. Three involved physicians, two involved mental health professionals and two involved multiple health professionals and students. Two were quasi-randomized, two were cluster randomized, and three were pre/post field studies. Study quality was low to moderate with none of high quality; most studies did not adequately control for potentially confounding variables. Effect size ranged from no effect to moderately beneficial (unable to assess in two studies). Three studies reported positive (beneficial) effects; none demonstrated a negative (harmful) effect.
CONCLUSION: There is limited research showing a positive relationship between cultural competency training and improved patient outcomes, but there remains a paucity of high quality research. Future work should address challenges limiting quality. We propose an algorithm to guide educators in designing and evaluating curricula, to rigorously demonstrate the impact on patient outcomes and health disparities.},

Using the important example of the African American patient, the authors examine relevant historical and cultural information as it relates to providing culturally competent health care. The authors identify key influences, including the legacy of slavery, Jim Crow discrimination, the Tuskegee syphilis study, religion's interaction with health care, the use of home remedies, distrust, racial concordance and discordance, and health literacy. The authors propose that the awareness of specific information pertaining to ethnicity and race enhances cross-cultural communication and ways to improve the cultural competence of physicians and other health care providers by providing a historical and social context for illness in another culture. Cultural education, modular in nature, can be geared to the specific populations served by groups of physicians and provider organizations. Educational methods should include both information about relevant social group history as well as some experiential component to emotively communicate particular cultural needs. The authors describe particular techniques that help bridge the cross-cultural clinical communication gaps that are created by patients' mistrust, lack of cultural understanding, differing paradigms for illness, and health illiteracy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prior studies have shown that racial/ethnic minorities have lower Consumer Assessments of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) scores. Perceived discrimination may mediate the relationship between race/ethnicity and patient experiences with care.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between perceived discrimination based on race/ethnicity and Medicaid insurance and CAHPS reports and ratings of care.
METHODS: The study analyzed 2007 survey data from 1509 Florida Medicaid beneficiaries. CAHPS reports (getting needed care, timeliness of care, communication with doctor, and health plan customer service) and ratings (personal doctor, specialist care, overall health care, and health plan) of care were the primary outcome variables. Patient perceptions of discrimination based on their race/ethnicity and having Medicaid insurance were the primary independent variables. Regression analysis modeled the effect of perceptions of discrimination on CAHPS reports and ratings controlling for age, sex, education, self-rated health status, race/ethnicity, survey language, and fee-for-service enrollment. SEs were corrected for correlation within plans.
RESULTS: Medicaid beneficiaries reporting discrimination based on race/ethnicity had lower CAHPS scores, ranging from 15 points lower (on a 0-100 scale) for getting needed care to 6 points lower for specialist rating, compared with those who never experienced discrimination. Similar results were obtained for perceived discrimination based on Medicaid insurance.
CONCLUSIONS: Perceptions of discrimination based on race/ethnicity and Medicaid insurance are prevalent and are associated with substantially lower CAHPS reports and ratings of care. Practices must develop and implement strategies to reduce perceived discrimination among patients.},

The possibility exists that, although the creators of a scale intended to create a scale measuring a single construct, the questions may seem to measure more than one construct. However, the possibility also exists that the questions do generally measure one construct, but several "nuisance" constructs influence the measurement of the construct indirectly. Unidimensional, multidimensional, and bifactor analytical models offer a method for establishing scale dimensionality and subsequently developing valid scoring systems. In this paper, we take an applied perspective, discuss these models and their implications, and use real data to provide an example.
METHODS: We used unidimensional, multidimensional, and bifactor analyses to examine the measurement structure of the Consumer Assessments of Healthcare Providers and Systems Cultural Competence (CAHPS-CC) Survey. Participants came from a 2008 sample of 2 Medicaid managed care plans, in New York and California.
RESULTS: Both unidimensional and bifactor models failed to fit the data well. A multidimensional model, with 7 factors corresponding to 7 cultural competence domains fit the data well (root mean square error of approximation=0.064; Tucker-Lewis Index=0.98; comparative fit index=0.97).
DISCUSSION: Results indicate that the CAHPS-CC does not seem to measure a single construct. Rather, the CAHPS-CC seems to measure 7 separable domains, suggesting the need for 7 separate scale scores. Our findings highlight the importance of conducting dimensionality analyses.},

	doi = {10.1097/MLR.0b013e3182610ad1},
	abstract = {Background
Cultural competency has been espoused as an organizational strategy to reduce health disparities in care.

Objective
To examine the relationship between hospital cultural competency and inpatient experiences with care.

Research Design
The first model predicted Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) scores from hospital random effects, plus fixed effects for hospital cultural competency, individual race/ethnicity/language, and case-mix variables. The second model tested if the association between a hospital’s cultural competency and HCAHPS scores differed for minority and non-Hispanic white patients.

Subjects
The National CAHPS® Benchmarking Database’s (NCBD) HCAHPS Surveys and the Cultural Competency Assessment Tool of Hospitals (CCATH) Surveys for California hospitals were merged, resulting in 66 hospitals and 19,583 HCAHPS respondents in 2006.

Measures
Dependent variables include ten HCAHPS measures: six composites (communication with doctors, communication with nurses, staff responsiveness, pain control, communication about medications, and discharge information), two individual items (cleanliness, and quietness of patient rooms), and two global items (overall hospital rating, and whether patient would recommend hospital).

Results
Hospitals with greater cultural competency have better HCAHPS scores for doctor communication, hospital rating, and hospital recommendation. Furthermore, HCAHPS scores for minorities were higher at hospitals with greater cultural competency on four other dimensions: nurse communication, staff responsiveness, quiet room, and pain control.

Conclusions
Greater hospital cultural competency may improve overall patient experiences, but may particularly benefit minorities in their interactions with nurses and hospital staff. Such effort may not only serve longstanding goals of reducing racial/ethnic disparities in inpatient experience, but may also contribute to general quality improvement.},

	abstract = {Objective: We sought to synthesize the findings of studies evaluating interventions to improve the cultural competence of health professionals. Design: This was a systematic literature review and analysis. Methods: We performed electronic and hand searches from 1980 through June 2003 to identify studies that evaluated interventions designed to improve the cultural competence of health professionals. We abstracted and synthesized data from studies that had both a before- and an after-intervention evaluation or had a control group for comparison and graded the strength of the evidence as excellent, good, fair, or poor using predetermined criteria. Main Outcome Measures: We sought evidence of the effectiveness and costs of cultural competence training of health professionals. Results: Thirty-four studies were included in our review. There is excellent evidence that cultural competence training improves the knowledge of health professionals (17 of 19 studies demonstrated a beneficial effect), and good evidence that cultural competence training improves the attitudes and skills of health professionals (21 of 25 studies evaluating attitudes demonstrated a beneficial effect and 14 of 14 studies evaluating skills demonstrated a beneficial effect). There is good evidence that cultural competence training impacts patient satisfaction (3 of 3 studies demonstrated a beneficial effect), poor evidence that cultural competence training impacts patient adherence (although the one study designed to do this demonstrated a beneficial effect), and no studies that have evaluated patient health status outcomes. There is poor evidence to determine the costs of cultural competence training (5 studies included incomplete estimates of costs). Conclusions: Cultural competence training shows promise as a strategy for improving the knowledge, attitudes, and skills of health professionals. However, evidence that it improves patient adherence to therapy, health outcomes, and equity of services across racial and ethnic groups is lacking. Future research should focus on these outcomes and should determine which teaching methods and content are most effective.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Cultural Competency Item Set assesses patient perceptions of aspects of the cultural competence of their health care.
OBJECTIVE: To determine characteristics of patients who identify the care they receive as less culturally competent.
RESEARCH DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey consisting of face-to-face interviews.
SUBJECTS: Safety-net population of patients with type 2 diabetes (n=600) receiving ongoing primary care.
MEASURES: Participants completed the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Cultural Competency and answered questions about their race/ethnicity, sex, age, education, health status, depressive symptoms, insurance coverage, English proficiency, duration of relationship with primary care provider, and comorbidities.
RESULTS: In adjusted models, depressive symptoms were significantly associated with poor cultural competency in the Doctor Communication--Positive Behaviors domain [odds ratio (OR) 1.73, 95\% confidence interval, 1.11-2.69]. African Americans were less likely than whites to report poor cultural competence in the Doctor Communication--Positive Behaviors domain (OR 0.52, 95\% CI, 0.28-0.97). Participants who reported a longer relationship (≥ 3 y) with their primary care provider were less likely to report poor cultural competence in the Doctor Communication--Health Promotion (OR 0.35, 95\% CI, 0.21-0.60) and Trust domains (OR 0.4, 95\% CI, 0.24-0.67), whereas participants with lower educational attainment were less likely to report poor cultural competence in the Trust domain (OR 0.51, 95\% CI, 0.30-0.86). Overall, however, sociodemographic and clinical differences in reports of poor cultural competence were insignificant or inconsistent across the various domains of cultural competence examined.
CONCLUSIONS: Cultural competence interventions in safety-net settings should be implemented across populations, rather than being narrowly focused on specific sociodemographic or clinical groups.},

	abstract = {Aims The aim of this study was to predict South Florida family caregivers' need for and use of informal help or formal services, specifically, to explore the predictive power of variables suggested by the Caregiver Identity Theory and the literature and develop and test a structural model. Background In the USA, most of the care to older adults is given by family members. Caregivers make economic and social sacrifices that endanger their health. They feel burdened, if they receive no assistance with their tasks; however, services available are not sufficiently used. Design This cross-sectional correlational study was a survey of family caregivers in their home, using standardized and/or pre-tested scales and a cognitive status test of their patients. Methods A random sample of 613 multiethnic caregivers of frail elders were recruited in home care and community agencies. The interviews were held between 2006-2009. Analyses involved correlation and regression analyses and structural equation modelling. Outcome measures were need and use of family help and formal services. Results/Findings The model yielded excellent fit indices replicated on three random samples of 370. The patients' functional limitations yielded the strongest predictive coefficients followed by caregiver stress. Cultural indicators played a minor role. Conclusion The lack of a link between resource need and use suggested access barriers. Important for policy makers and service providers are the delivery of high-quality services and the use of a personal and individualized approach with all ethnicities. Quality service includes understanding the caregiving situations and requires a trusting relationship with family caregivers.},

	abstract = {Type 2 diabetes mellitus is known to affect adults in racial and ethnic minority groups disproportionately. When diabetes mellitus-related symptoms lead to the need for skilled care in the community-dwelling Medicare population, physicians can order the Medicare home health care (HHC) benefit, and Medicare-certified home health agencies can deliver it. Little is known about the extent to which racial and ethnic disparities exist in types and patterns of HHC services delivered to Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes mellitus when they are approved for the Medicare HHC benefit. This was examined by comparing racial and ethnic groups in terms of measures of HHC service use in a nationally representative sample of Medicare HHC beneficiaries with a primary diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Uniform clinical data from the Outcome and Assessment Information Set were linked with Medicare HHC claims for beneficiaries who received a complete episode of HHC in 2002. In the study sample (n=9,838), 62\% of participants self-identified as white, 22\% African American, 12\% Hispanic, and 3\% Asian. Nearly all (99\%) participants in all racial and ethnic groups received skilled nursing services. Controlling for numerous sociodemographic and health-related covariates and geographic region of the country, African-American participants received fewer nurse visits per week and fewer visits per week from all clinical disciplines combined than whites (both P{\textless}.001), and Hispanic participants were less likely than whites to receive physical therapy (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=0.640, 95\% confidence interval (CI)=0.543-0.754, P{\textless}.001) or home health aide (AOR=0.716, 95\% CI=0.582-0.880, P=.002) services. Lower use of skilled nursing and rehabilitation services by African Americans and of rehabilitation services by Hispanics warrant further clinical and research attention. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Background High-risk organisations, such as the airline industry and the petroleum industry, have long been preoccupied with safety. Only recently has this also become a central theme in health care. Method Four focus group interviews with 20 nurses who work in home care. A qualitative thematic analysis was performed. Results One main theme was identified: struggling with responsibility in different situations. It comprises five subthemes: poor work morale and work ethic; documentation; lack of functional leadership; competence; and lack of updated routines and guidelines. Conclusions Patient safety culture is compromised by a lack of leadership, lack of responsibility among leadership, lack of routines, failure to update procedures, and a lack of knowledge and education among health-care workers. Implications for nursing management Nurse managers need to be made more aware of the dilemmas faced by nurses, how they struggle with their responsibilities, how they experience powerlessness in certain situations, and the lack of support they receive in decision-making.},

	abstract = {Purpose/Objectives: To explore the feasibility of rural home telemonitoring for patients with lung cancer.Design: Exploratory, descriptive, observational.Setting: Patient homes within a 75-mile radius of the study hospital in West Virginia.Sample: 10 patients hospitalized with lung cancer as a primary or secondary-related diagnosis.Methods: Data included referral and demographics, chart reviews, and clinical data collected using a HomMed telemonitor. Five patients received usual care after discharge; five had telemonitors set up at home for 14 days with daily phone calls for nurse coaching; mid- and end-study data were collected by phone and in homes through two months.Main Research Variables: Enrollment and retention characteristics, physiologic (e.g., temperature, pulse, blood pressure, weight, O2 saturation) and 10 symptom datapoints, patient and family telemonitor satisfaction.Findings: Of 45 referred patients, only 10 consented; 1 of 5 usual care and 3 of 5 monitored patients completed the entire study. Telemonitored data transmission was feasible in rural areas with high satisfaction; symptom data and physiologic data were inconsistent but characteristic of lung cancer.Conclusions: Challenges included environment, culture, technology, and overall enrollment and retention. Physiologic and symptom changes were important data for nurse coaching on risks, symptom management, and clinician contact.Implications for Nursing: Enrollment and retention in cancer research warrants additional study. Daily monitoring is feasible and important in risk assessment, but length of time to monitor signs and symptoms, which changed rapidly, is unclear. Symptom changes were useful as proxy indicators for physiologic changes, so risk outcomes may be assessable by phone for patient self-management coaching by nurses. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

	abstract = {Background: theoretical guidance and policy directives emphasize the necessity of considering the culturally-specific needs of health and social care service users as part of 'person-centred' approaches to care. This article outlines the ideas underpinning an ongoing PhD study of the interactions between care staff and residents which is aimed at gaining insights into how person-centred care is fulfilled for people with dementia in Scottish care homes. Discussion: certain dynamics may constrain the deployment of culturally-meaningful care approaches for certain service users in Scottish care homes. These include limited understandings of the nature of cultural diversity in modern Scotland, failure to recognize the import of 'inter-generational' cultural change, lack of research around the interactions between staff and service users from different cultural backgrounds, and a sketchy demographic picture of the ethnic/cultural composition of Scottish care home populations. Groups of service users in particular settings (such as older people with dementia in long-term care) may be especially vulnerable to the effects of care processes constituted under such circumstances. Conclusion: poorly recognized gaps in understanding of the sociocultural and historical influences which help constitute 'the person' in many Scottish care home residents may exist. If these are found to constrain 'knowing the person', can the term 'person-centred' be meaningfully applied to care? [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Although many Mexican American (MA) elders could benefit from home care services (HCS), many MA elders and family caregivers resist using these services. The purpose of this study was to test using cafecitos and telenovelas to affect MA elders’ and caregivers’ attitudes toward use of HCS. Cafecitos are traditional informal discussions among similar people. Discussions about attitudes toward using HCS were tested with 3 samples in 3 settings at local and neighborhood associations (n = 43). Telenovelas are dramatizations of compelling stories in Spanish. These were tested with 4 samples in 4 settings (n = 55). Todo ha cambiado portrayed the story of an older MA woman who grappled with her attitudes toward using HCS. Themes of the cafecitos indicated that participation increased knowledge that HCS existed. Anecdotal comments revealed that the participants identified with the Telenovela story. Although the pilot sample was too small to derive statistical significance, comparisons of pre- and posttests showed a trend toward increased knowledge. Cafecitos and telenovelas are promising, culturally competent strategies for increasing MA elders’ and caregivers’ knowledge and willingness to consider using HCS.},

While disavowing the theory that cultural mistrust has its origin in any single factor or event, it is argued          that there needs only to exist the cultural construct of community for cultural mistrust to perpetuate itself among any ethnic group. The attitudes toward hospice care are advanced as illustrative of the          relationship between African Americans and the health care system, and many other institutions of American society. From a perspective that accepts the existence of the phenomenon of cultural mistrust,          suggestions for structuring training for cultural competence are discussed. These suggestions are relevant for workers in institutions that serve the African American community in critical health care areas          in general, and administrators and staff of hospices in particular.},

This review identifies the content of virtual visits in community nursing services to older adults and explores the manner in which service users and the nurses use virtual visits. Design. An integrative literature review. Method. Data collection comprised a literature search in three databases: Cinahl, Medline, and PubMed. In addition, a manual search of reference lists and expert consultation were performed. A total of 12 articles met the inclusion criteria. The articles were reviewed in terms of study characteristics, service content and utilization, and patient and health care provider experience. Results. Our review shows that in most studies the service is delivered on a daily basis and in combination with in-person visits. The findings suggest that older home-dwelling patients can benefit from virtual visits in terms of enhanced social inclusion and medication compliance. Service users and their nurses found virtual visits satisfactory and suitable for care delivery in home care to the elderly. Evidence for cost-saving benefits of virtual visits was not found. Conclusions. The findings can inform the planning of virtual visits in home health care as a complementary service to in-person visits, in order to meet the increasingly complex needs of older adults living at home.},

The main issues facing older people are physical decline, cognitive decline, health management, and psychosocial issues. Robots exist that may meet some of the identified issues but gaps where robots could be developed include delivering interventions to prevent physical decline occurring and robots with multiple functions, including a range of cognitive stimuli and health education. To reduce barriers to acceptance, robots designed to provide physical and healthcare assistance should have a serious appearance. On the other hand animal-like robots can address psychosocial issues and function like pets. While smart phones and computers can offer some solutions, robots may promote adherence due to a social presence. Robots are being developed to address areas of need in older people, including physical, cognitive, medical and psychosocial issues. However more focus could be placed on developing preventative interventions, multifunctional robots, greater educational content and motivational aspects of appearance and interaction style.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diabetes in elderly adults is associated with an increased risk of fall. The aim of study was to determine whether a virtual reality exercise (VRE) program would improve balance, strength, gait, and falls efficacy in elderly adults with diabetes.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fifty-five subjects with diabetes mellitus over 65 years of age were randomly assigned to a VRE group (VREG) (n=27) and a control group (CG) (n=28). The VREG received the VRE program and diabetes education, whereas the CG received only the diabetes education. The VRE program used video gaming (PlayStation(®) 2; Sony, Tokyo, Japan) and was conducted for 50 min twice a week for 10 weeks. Balance, muscle strength, gait, and falls efficacy were measured at baseline and after intervention. Measurements were taken using a clinical tests (the one-leg-standing test, the Berg Balance Scale, the functional reach test, the timed up-and-go test, and the sit-to-stand test), and gait analysis. A self-administered questionnaire was used to measure falls efficacy.
RESULTS: After training, the VREG showed significantly improved balance, decreased sit-to-stand times, and increased gait speed, cadence, and falls efficacy.
CONCLUSIONS: The VRE program was to maximize the effects of exercise by triggering players was to be fully immersed into the games and enhanced major influential factors on the falls of subject. This study suggests VRE programs are feasible and effective for reduced the risk of falls in elderly adults with type 2 diabetes.},

Even without injury, falls cause a loss of confidence that results in reduced physical activity, increased dependency, and social withdrawal. As a home care agency dealing with a geriatric population, our goal was to develop a user-friendly fall prevention program that would promote multidisciplinary assessment and intervention.

	doi = {10.1519/JPT.0b013e3182abe779},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Falls represent a significant threat to the health and independence of adults aged 65 years and older. As a wide variety and large number of passive monitoring systems are currently and increasingly available to detect when individuals have fallen, there is a need to analyze and synthesize the evidence regarding their ability to accurately detect falls to determine which systems are most effective.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this literature review is to systematically assess the current state of design and implementation of fall-detection devices. This review also examines to what extent these devices have been tested in the real world as well as the acceptability of these devices to older adults.
DATA SOURCES: A systematic literature review was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, and PsycINFO from their respective inception dates to June 25, 2013.
STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND INTERVENTIONS: Articles were included if they discussed a project or multiple projects involving a system with the purpose of detecting a fall in adults. It was not a requirement for inclusion in this review that the system targets persons older than 65 years. Articles were excluded if they were not written in English or if they looked at fall risk, fall detection in children, fall prevention, or a personal emergency response device.
STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Studies were initially divided into those using sensitivity, specificity, or accuracy in their evaluation methods and those using other methods to evaluate their devices. Studies were further classified into wearable devices and nonwearable devices. Studies were appraised for inclusion of older adults in sample and if evaluation included real-world settings.
RESULTS: This review identified 57 projects that used wearable systems and 35 projects using nonwearable systems, regardless of evaluation technique. Nonwearable systems included cameras, motion sensors, microphones, and floor sensors. Of the projects examining wearable systems, only 7.1\% reported monitoring older adults in a real-world setting. There were no studies of nonwearable devices that used older adults as subjects in either a laboratory or a real-world setting. In general, older adults appear to be interested in using such devices although they express concerns over privacy and understanding exactly what the device is doing at specific times.
LIMITATIONS: This systematic review was limited to articles written in English and did not include gray literature. Manual paper screening and review processes may have been subject to interpretive bias.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS OF KEY FINDINGS: There exists a large body of work describing various fall-detection devices. The challenge in this area is to create highly accurate unobtrusive devices. From this review it appears that the technology is becoming more able to accomplish such a task. There is a need now for more real-world tests as well as standardization of the evaluation of these devices.},

	volume = {56},
	issn = {1079-5006},
	shorttitle = {Frailty in older adults},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Frailty is considered highly prevalent in old age and to confer high risk for falls, disability, hospitalization, and mortality. Frailty has been considered synonymous with disability, comorbidity, and other characteristics, but it is recognized that it may have a biologic basis and be a distinct clinical syndrome. A standardized definition has not yet been established.
METHODS: To develop and operationalize a phenotype of frailty in older adults and assess concurrent and predictive validity, the study used data from the Cardiovascular Health Study. Participants were 5,317 men and women 65 years and older (4,735 from an original cohort recruited in 1989-90 and 582 from an African American cohort recruited in 1992-93). Both cohorts received almost identical baseline evaluations and 7 and 4 years of follow-up, respectively, with annual examinations and surveillance for outcomes including incident disease, hospitalization, falls, disability, and mortality.
RESULTS: Frailty was defined as a clinical syndrome in which three or more of the following criteria were present: unintentional weight loss (10 lbs in past year), self-reported exhaustion, weakness (grip strength), slow walking speed, and low physical activity. The overall prevalence of frailty in this community-dwelling population was 6.9\%; it increased with age and was greater in women than men. Four-year incidence was 7.2\%. Frailty was associated with being African American, having lower education and income, poorer health, and having higher rates of comorbid chronic diseases and disability. There was overlap, but not concordance, in the cooccurrence of frailty, comorbidity, and disability. This frailty phenotype was independently predictive (over 3 years) of incident falls, worsening mobility or ADL disability, hospitalization, and death, with hazard ratios ranging from 1.82 to 4.46, unadjusted, and 1.29-2.24, adjusted for a number of health, disease, and social characteristics predictive of 5-year mortality. Intermediate frailty status, as indicated by the presence of one or two criteria, showed intermediate risk of these outcomes as well as increased risk of becoming frail over 3-4 years of follow-up (odds ratios for incident frailty = 4.51 unadjusted and 2.63 adjusted for covariates, compared to those with no frailty criteria at baseline).
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a potential standardized definition for frailty in community-dwelling older adults and offers concurrent and predictive validity for the definition. It also finds that there is an intermediate stage identifying those at high risk of frailty. Finally, it provides evidence that frailty is not synonymous with either comorbidity or disability, but comorbidity is an etiologic risk factor for, and disability is an outcome of, frailty. This provides a potential basis for clinical assessment for those who are frail or at risk, and for future research to develop interventions for frailty based on a standardized ascertainment of frailty.},

	issn = {0098-7484},
	abstract = {CONTEXT: Although various fall-induced injuries and deaths among older adults are increasing, little is known about the epidemiology of these events.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the trends in the number and incidence of fall-induced injuries and deaths of older adults in a well-defined white population.
DESIGN AND SETTING: Secular trend analysis of the population of Finland, using the Finnish National Hospital Discharge Register and the Official Cause-of-Death Statistics of Finland.
PARTICIPANTS: All persons aged 50 years or older who were admitted to hospitals in Finland for primary treatment of a first fall-induced injury from the years of 1970 to 1995, and for comparison, all fall-induced deaths in the same age group from the years 1971 to 1995.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The number and the age-specific and age-adjusted incidence rate (per 100000 persons) of fall-induced injuries and deaths in each year of the study.
RESULTS: For the study period, both the total and population-adjusted number (per 100000 persons) of Finns aged 50 years or older with fall-induced injury increased substantially. Total fall-induced injuries increased from 5622 in 1970 to 21 574 in 1995, a 284\% increase, and the rate increased from 494 to 1398 per 100000 persons, a 183\% increase. The age-adjusted incidence also increased in both women (from 648 in 1970 to 1469 in 1995, a 127\% increase) and men (from 434 in 1970 to 972 in 1995, a 124\% increase). Moreover, the number of deaths due to falls in the overall population increased from 441 in 1971 to 793 in 1995, an 80\% increase, and the rate increased from 38 in 1971 to 51 in 1995, a 34\% increase. However, after age adjustment the incidence of fall-induced death did not show a clear upward trend.
CONCLUSIONS: In a well-defined white population, the number of older persons with fall-induced injuries is increasing at a rate that cannot be explained simply by demographic changes. Preventive measures should be adopted to control the increasing burden of these injuries. Fortunately, the age-adjusted incidence of the fall-induced deaths shows no increasing trend over time.},

	abstract = {Background
Falls are a serious health problem in old adults especially in nursing home residents and hospitalized patients. To prevent elderly from falling, sensors have been increasingly used in intramural care settings. However, there is no clear overview of the current used technologies and their results in fall prevention.
Objectives
The present study reviews sensor systems that prevent falls in geriatric patients living in an intramural setting and describe fall rates, fall-related injuries, false alarms, and user experience associated with such systems.
Methods
We conducted a systematic search for studies that used sensor technologies with the aim to prevent falls in institutionalized geriatric patients.
Results
A total of 12 studies met the search criteria. Three randomized clinical trials reported no reductions in fall rate but three before–after studies reported significant reductions of 2.4–37 falls per 1000 patient days. Although there was up to 77\% reduction in fall-related injuries and there was relatively low, 16\%, rate of false alarms, the current data are inconsistent whether current sensor technologies are effective in reducing the number of falls in institutionalized geriatric patients. The occurrence of false alarms (16\%) was too high to maintain full attention of the nursing staff. Additionally including the users opinion and demands in developing and introducing sensor systems into intramural care settings seems to be required to make an intervention successful.
Conclusion
The evidence is inconsistent whether the current sensor systems can prevent falls and fall-related injuries in institutionalized elderly. Further research should focus more comprehensively on user requirements and effective ways using intelligent alarms.},

Assessments for frail older adults should include observations of not only the physical environment, but also the interactions among the environment, behavior, and physical functioning so that interventions are tailored to the specific situation of the individual. Home modification and technology can prove useful when designing interventions aimed at reducing fall risks. Problems such as cost, reluctance to adopt or implement suggestions, and a lack of knowledge may present barriers to effective home modification. Program and policy options for the future include improved training for service personnel who visit the homes of older adults, increased awareness of and coordination between programs or interventions aimed at reducing the risk of falls in older adults, new sources of funding, and building more housing that follows the principles of universal design.},

	abstract = {Falls remain an important problem in older people. There is strong evidence that falls can be prevented with appropriately designed intervention programs. In order to start a targeted fall prevention program a first step is to identify those at high risk of falls. Sensor-based tests hold great promise for more frequent and accurate assessment of fall risk in clinical and home settings. The aims of this study were to 1) empirically examine the feasibility of the iStoppFalls assessment (ICT-based System to Predict \& Prevent Falls), a Kinect and inertial sensor-based test for regular and unsupervised fall risk assessments at home, 2) investigate the experience of older adults with this home-based self-assessment and 3) make recommendations for future assessments. The iStoppFalls assessment system was installed into the homes of 62 community-living older people in Australia, Germany and Spain for the duration of 4 months. Participants were asked to perform at least one assessment each month. The system use and the user experience were evaluated. To our knowledge, these are the first results on the long-term use of an unsupervised directed routine fall risk assessment system at private homes. In total, 241 assessments were independently performed by the participants. Most participants felt positive about their experience and could see themselves continuing with the assessment on a regular basis. Through the analysis the user motivation, the design and selection of appropriate tests, the user feedback, the reliability and usability of the applied technology, the frequency and duration of the assessment and the safety and support aspects were identified as important characteristics of a home-based self-assessment. The findings demonstrate the feasibility of a sensor-based self-assessment for fall risk, but also highlight that further work is necessary. Future research should consider the necessary design requirements identified by this study.},

Frail individuals are at increased risk for the development of disability, dementia, and falls. There are hardly any health services that enable the identification of prefrail individuals and that focus on prevention of further functional decline. In this paper, we discuss the development of a community-based, technology-supported health service for detecting prefrailty and preventing frailty and further functional decline via participatory design with a wide range of stakeholders. The result is an innovative service model in which an online platform supports the integration of traditional services with novel, Information Communication Technology supported tools. This service is capable of supporting the different phases of screening and offers training services, by also integrating them with community-based services. The service model can be used as a basis for developing similar services within a wide range of healthcare systems. We present the service model, the general functioning of the technology platform, and the different ways in which screening for and prevention of frailty has been localized. Finally, we reflect on the added value of participatory design for creating such health services.},

	abstract = {Objective
Obtain the views of nurses and assistants as to why patients in acute care hospitals fall.

Background
Despite a large quantitative evidence base for guiding fall risk assessment and not needing highly technical, scarce, or expensive equipment to prevent falls, falls are serious problems in hospitals.

Methods
Basic content analysis methods were used to interpret descriptive data from 4 focus groups with nurses (n = 23) and 4 with assistants (n = 19). A 2-person consensus approach was used for analysis.

Results
Positive and negative components of 6 concepts—patient report, information access, signage, environment, teamwork, and involving patient/family—formed 2 core categories: knowledge/communication and capability/actions that are facilitators or barriers, respectively, to preventing falls.

Conclusion
Two conditions are required to reduce patient falls. A patient care plan including current and accurate fall risk status with associated tailored and feasible interventions needs to be easily and immediately accessible to all stakeholders (entire healthcare team, patients, and family). Second, stakeholders must use that information plus their own knowledge and skills and patient and hospital resources to carry out the plan.},

	abstract = {Context
Falls cause injury and death for persons of all ages, but risk of falls increases markedly with age. Hospitalization further increases risk, yet no evidence exists to support short-stay hospital-based fall prevention strategies to reduce patient falls.

Objective
To investigate whether a fall prevention tool kit (FPTK) using health information technology (HIT) decreases patient falls in hospitals.

Design, Setting, and Patients
Cluster randomized study conducted January 1, 2009, through June 30, 2009, comparing patient fall rates in 4 urban US hospitals in units that received usual care (4 units and 5104 patients) or the intervention (4 units and 5160 patients).

Intervention
The FPTK integrated existing communication and workflow patterns into the HIT application. Based on a valid fall risk assessment scale completed by a nurse, the FPTK software tailored fall prevention interventions to address patients’ specific determinants of fall risk. The FPTK produced bed posters composed of brief text with an accompanying icon, patient education handouts, and plans of care, all communicating patient-specific alerts to key stakeholders.

Main Outcome Measures
The primary outcome was patient falls per 1000 patient-days adjusted for site and patient care unit. A secondary outcome was fall-related injuries.

Results
During the 6-month intervention period, the number of patients with falls differed between control (n=87) and intervention (n=67) units (P=.02). Site-adjusted fall rates were significantly higher in control units (4.18 [95\% confidence interval \{CI\}, 3.45-5.06] per 1000 patient-days) than in intervention units (3.15 [95\% CI, 2.54-3.90] per 1000 patient-days; P=.04). The FPTK was found to be particularly effective with patients aged 65 years or older (adjusted rate difference, 2.08 [95\% CI, 0.61-3.56] per 1000 patient-days; P=.003). No significant effect was noted in fall-related injuries.

Conclusion
The use of a fall prevention tool kit in hospital units compared with usual care significantly reduced rate of falls.},

	abstract = {Falls in adults aged 65 years and older are an important health issue associated with excess mortality, functional limitations, loss of independence, and reduced quality of life. Physicians can reduce the likelihood of falls in their older patients by incorporating prevention strategies into their clinical practice. Research has identified effective interventions, notably clinical assessment and risk factor reduction and exercise programs with balance training, that require older adults to adopt new behaviors. However, some older adults believe falls are an inevitable consequence of aging, while others do not see themselves as personally vulnerable. Factors that facilitate adopting fall interventions include social support, low-intensity exercise, and the perception that the programs are relevant. Barriers include fatalism, denial of risk, poor self-efficacy, and no previous history of exercise. To encourage their patients’ participation, physicians need to present fall interventions as lifestyle enhancing and as a way to remain independent. Messages should focus on positive health and social benefits such as improving balance and maintaining independence, rather than emphasizing negative information about falls and fall injuries. Along with the support of family and friends, a personal invitation from a health care provider will encourage older adults to take part in fall prevention programs.},

Several standards are required to produce the functional and semantic interoperability necessary to support the exchange of such data: a common reference information model, a common set of data elements, a common terminology, common data structures, and a common transport standard. This paper addresses one component of that set of standards: the ability to create a document that supports the exchange of structured data components. Unfortunately, two different standards development organizations have produced similar standards for that purpose based on different information models: Health Level 7 (HL7)'s Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) and The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM International) Continuity of Care Record (CCR). The coexistence of both standards might require mapping from one standard to the other, which could be accompanied by a loss of information and functionality. This paper examines and compares the two standards, emphasizes the strengths and weaknesses of each, and proposes a strategy of harmonization to enhance future progress. While some of the authors are members of HL7 and/or ASTM International, the authors stress that the viewpoints represented in this paper are those of the authors and do not represent the official viewpoints of either HL7 or of ASTM International.},

Together, these themes suggest ways in which FDDs may be improved so that they are suitable for their intended population.},

Some items were taken from the Health Information National Trends Survey. Of 1520 surveys, 403 were returned completed (26.6\%). Respondents’ mean age was 77.65 years. Average scores indicated respondents trusted particular sources of health information in the following order (highest to lowest): health care providers, pharmacists, friends and relatives, retirement community staff, newspapers, the Internet, television, and the radio. In conclusion, older adults have a greater amount of trust in a person with whom they are able to actively discuss their health as opposed to a nonliving source, which they have to access or manipulate, such as the Internet. Efforts must be made to help older adults better navigate and utilize the Internet and recognize dependable online sources so that they may increase their trust in its use, thereby increasing satisfaction with their own ability to seek and use sources of health information.},

However, ED use among the rural elderly has seldom been studied and is little understood. Purpose: To characterize factors associated with having any versus no ED use among the rural elderly. Methods: A cross-sectional and observational study of 1,736 Medicare beneficiaries age 65 and older who live in nonmetropolitan areas. The data are from the 2002 to 2005 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). A logistic regression model was estimated that included measures of predisposing characteristics, enabling factors, need variables, and health behavior as suggested by Anderson's behavioral model of health service utilization. Findings: During a 1-year period, 20.8\% of the sample had at least 1 ED visit. Being widowed, more educated, enrolled in Medicaid, with fair/poor self-perceived physical health, respiratory diseases, and heart disease were associated with a higher likelihood of having any ED visits. However, residing in the western and southern United States and being enrolled in Medicaid managed care were associated with lower probability of having any ED visits. While Medicaid enrollees who reported excellent, very good, good, or fair physical health were more likely to have at least 1 ED visit than those not on Medicaid, Medicaid enrollees reporting poor physical health may be less likely to have any ED visits. Conclusion: Policy makers and hospital administrators should consider these factors when managing the need for emergency care, including developing interventions to provide needed care through alternate means.},

	doi = {10.1097/MLR.0000000000000401},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hospitals are focused on improving postdischarge services for older adults, such as early follow-up care after hospitalization to reduce readmissions and unnecessary emergency department (ED) use. Rural Medicare beneficiaries face many barriers to receiving quality care, but little is known about their postdischarge care and outcomes. We hypothesize that rural Medicare beneficiaries compared with urban beneficiaries, will have fewer follow-up visits, and a greater likelihood of readmission and ED use.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of elderly Medicare beneficiaries discharged home using the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey, Cost and Use files, 2000-2010. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the risk of rural residency on readmission, ED use, and follow-up care up to 30 days' postdischarge. Covariates include demographic, health, and hospital-level characteristics.
RESULTS: Compared with urban beneficiaries, Medicare beneficiaries living in isolated rural settings had a lower rate of follow-up care [hazard ratio (HR)=0.81, P{\textless}0.001]. Beneficiaries in large and small rural settings had a greater risk of an ED visit compared with urban beneficiaries (HR=1.44, P{\textless}0.001; HR=1.52, P{\textless}0.01). Rural beneficiaries did not have a greater risk of readmission, though risk of readmission was higher for beneficiaries discharged from hospitals in large and small rural settings (HR=1.33, P{\textless}0.05; HR=1.42, P{\textless}0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of lower quality postdischarge care for Medicare beneficiaries in rural settings. As readmission penalties expand, hospitals serving rural beneficiaries may be disproportionately affected. This suggests a need for policies that increase follow-up care in rural settings.},

	abstract = {Background
There is limited research on rural–urban disparities in U.S. life expectancy. Purpose
This study examined trends in rural–urban disparities in life expectancy at birth in the U.S. between 1969 and 2009.
Methods
The 1969–2009 U.S. county-level mortality data linked to a rural–urban continuum measure were analyzed. Life expectancies were calculated by age, gender, and race for 3-year time periods between 1969 and 2004 and for 2005–2009 using standard life-table methodology. Differences in life expectancy were decomposed by age and cause of death.
Results
Life expectancy was inversely related to levels of rurality. In 2005–2009, those in large metropolitan areas had a life expectancy of 79.1 years, compared with 76.9 years in small urban towns and 76.7 years in rural areas. When stratified by gender, race, and income, life expectancy ranged from 67.7 years among poor black men in nonmetropolitan areas to 89.6 among poor Asian/Pacific Islander women in metropolitan areas. Rural–urban disparities widened over time. In 1969–1971, life expectancy was 0.4 years longer in metropolitan than in nonmetropolitan areas (70.9 vs 70.5 years). By 2005–2009, the life expectancy difference had increased to 2.0 years (78.8 vs 76.8 years). The rural poor and rural blacks currently experience survival probabilities that urban rich and urban whites enjoyed 4 decades earlier. Causes of death contributing most to the increasing rural–urban disparity and lower life expectancy in rural areas include heart disease, unintentional injuries, COPD, lung cancer, stroke, suicide, and diabetes.
Conclusions
Between 1969 and 2009, residents in metropolitan areas experienced larger gains in life expectancy than those in nonmetropolitan areas, contributing to the widening gap.},

There is a growing international focus on patient-centered care. A model designed to facilitate this type of care in the primary care setting is the patient-centered medical home. This model of care strives to be patient-focused, comprehensive, team-based, coordinated, accessible, and focused on quality and safety of care.

Objective
The objective of this paper is to identify the current status and future trends of patient-centered care and the role of informatics systems and tools in facilitating this model of care.

Methods
In this paper we review recent scientific literature of the past four years to identify trends and state of current evidence when it comes to patient-centered care overall, and more specifically medical homes.

Results
There are several studies that indicate growth and development in seven informatics areas within patient-centered care, namely clinical decision support, registries, team care, care transitions, personal health records, telehealth, and measurement. In some cases we are still lacking large randomized clinical trials and the evidence base is not always solid, but findings strongly indicate the potential of informatics to support patient-centered care.

Conclusion
Current evidence indicates that advancements have been made in implementing and evaluating patient-centered care models. Technical, legal, and practical challenges still remain. Further examination of the impact of patient-centered informatics tools and systems on clinical outcomes is needed.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This research examines the impact of rural–urban residence on formal home-care utilization among older people and determines whether and how Medicaid coverage influences the association between rural–urban location and risk of formal home-care use. Design and Methods: We combined data from the 1998 consolidated file of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Household Component with data from the Area Resource File to generate the analytical data set. We established two measures of formal home-care utilization: home care reimbursed through any source, and Medicare-reimbursed home health care. Our measures of rural–urban residence included metropolitan counties, nonmetropolitan counties having towns of at least 10,000 people, and nonmetropolitan counties with no towns of 10,000 people. We used logistic regression analyses to examine main effects and interaction effects of Medicaid coverage and residence on the two types of formal home care under controls for person-level characteristics and state fixed effects. Results: The unadjusted logistic analyses demonstrate that older people who reside in the most rural counties (nonmetropolitan counties having no town of 10,000) are significantly more likely than metropolitan residents to use any formal home care and Medicare home health care. The fully adjusted logistic analysis results point to an interplay between residential status and Medicaid coverage with regard to formal home-care use. In comparison with metropolitan residents covered by Medicaid, the adjusted relative risk of any formal home-care use is significantly higher for Medicaid enrollees residing in nonmetropolitan counties having no town of 10,000 people. Use of Medicare home health care is significantly greater for residents of the most rural counties, irrespective of their Medicaid coverage, as well as Medicaid-covered residents of nonmetropolitan counties having a town of at least 10,000 people. Implications: In nonmetropolitan areas, Medicaid may be an important mechanism for linking older individuals with formal home care, especially Medicare home health care, and with the services that generate formal home care. Formal home care, including Medicare home health care, may substitute for less available forms of care in the most rural of nonmetropolitan areas. Therefore, policies that limit access to formal home care could lead to increased service-related vulnerabilities among older rural residents.},

	abstract = {The complex health, socioeconomic, and environmental problems experienced by many American elders often place them at high risk for disease and disability. Over time, acutely or chronically ill older persons experience numerous transitions across various health care settings. Although availability of health services is improving in rural areas, barriers such as distance, geography, and poor distribution often limit access to health care. In a longitudinal rural ethnography, the health care transition experiences of older adults, families, and health care providers were examined. A major ethnographic theme emerged from analysis data from interviews, participant observations, and photographs: the crisis nature of health care transitions experienced by rural older adults and their families and observed by rural nurses and other health care providers. Several patterns were observed including the crisis was compounded by surprise; limited knowledge of local resources exacerbated the crisis; inconsistent discharge planning disrupted transitions; changing family support necessitated admission to nursing homes; continuity of care in nursing home discharge lessened transition crisis; and rural home health care was identified as a strength. Recommendations were made for community-based interventions to improve the transition experience. Comprehensive care management services provided by public health nurses (PHNs) in the local rural community were recommended.},

Methods: Data were collected from two complementary studies: (a) fiscal and use data collected from 10 rural agencies in northwest Pennsylvania and (b) a statewide survey of rural home health agencies in Pennsylvania. Results: The findings show that the implementation of interim and prospective payment systems had a profound affect on the home health agencies’ financial vulnerability, staffing management, and service delivery. As a result, Medicare beneficiaries were also affected. The total number of home health visits per episode in rural Pennsylvania was 16 visits, whereas the national estimate was 22 visits. Physical therapy services increased 8\% and occupational therapy services increased 1\%, whereas visits for other disciplines decreased or remain unchanged. Discussion: Future studies are needed to examine the health outcomes of beneficiaries in rural communities.},

Methods: The 2002 100\% Medicare HHC claims and denominator files were used to estimate use of HHC and to make urban-rural comparisons on the basis of utilization levels within ZIP codes. Findings: Overall, the proportion of Medicare beneficiaries living in areas with little HHC utilization is relatively low. Rural elders, however, are more likely than their urban counterparts to live in such areas. Less than 1\% of urban beneficiaries live in ZIP codes with no or low use of HHC, but over 17\% of the most rural beneficiaries live in such areas.

	abstract = {Objectives
(1) To demonstrate average length of service (ALOS) bias in the currently used acute-care hospitalization (ACH) home health quality measure, limiting comparability across agencies, and (2) to propose alternative ACH measures.

Data Sources/Study Setting
Secondary analysis of Medicare home health service data 2004–2007; convenience sample of Medicare fee-for-service hospital discharges.

Study Design
Cross-sectional analysis and patient-level simulation.

Data Collection/Extraction Methods
We aggregated outcome and ALOS data from 2,347 larger Medicare-certified home health agencies (HHAs) in the United States between 2004 and 2007, and calculated risk-adjusted monthly ACH rates. We used multiple regression to identify agency characteristics associated with ACH. We simulated ACH during and immediately after home health care using patient and agency characteristics similar to those in the actual data, comparing the existing measure with alternative fixed-interval measures.

Principal Findings
Of agency characteristics studied, ALOS had by far the highest partial correlation with the current ACH measure (r2=0.218, p{\textless}.0001). We replicated the correlation between ACH and ALOS in the patient-level simulation. We found no correlation between ALOS and the alternative measures.

Conclusions
Alternative measures do not exhibit ALOS bias and would be appropriate for comparing HHA ACH rates with one another or over time.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Rural residents have higher rates of chronic diseases compared to their urban counterparts, and obesity may be a major contributor to this disparity. This study is the first analysis of obesity prevalence in rural and urban adults using body mass index classification with measured height and weight. In addition, demographic, diet, and physical activity correlates of obesity across rural and urban residence are examined.

Methods
Analysis of body mass index (BMI), diet, and physical activity from 7,325 urban and 1,490 rural adults in the 2005–2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).

Findings
The obesity prevalence was 39.6\% (SE = 1.5) among rural adults compared to 33.4\% (SE = 1.1) among urban adults (P = .006). Prevalence of obesity remained significantly higher among rural compared to urban adults controlling for demographic, diet, and physical activity variables (odds ratio = 1.18, P = .03). Race/ethnicity and percent kcal from fat were significant correlates of obesity among both rural and urban adults. Being married was associated with obesity only among rural residents, whereas older age, less education, and being inactive was associated with obesity only among urban residents.

Conclusions
Obesity is markedly higher among adults from rural versus urban areas of the United States, with estimates that are much higher than the rates suggested by studies with self-reported data. Obesity deserves greater attention in rural America.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Patients in rural areas may use less medical care than those living in urban areas. This could be due to differences in travel distance and time and a utilization of a different mix of generalists and specialists for their care.
PURPOSE: To compare the travel times, distances, and physician specialty mix of all Medicare patients living in Alaska, Idaho, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Washington.
METHODS: Retrospective design, using 1998 Medicare billing data. Travel time was determined by computing the road distance between 2 population centroids: the patient's and the provider's zone improvement plan codes.
FINDINGS: There were 2,220,841 patients and 39,780 providers in the cohort, including 6,405 (16.1\%) generalists, 24,772 (62.3\%) specialists, and 8,603 (21.6\%) nonphysician providers. There were 20,693,828 patient visits during the study. The median overall 1-way travel distance and time was 7.7 miles (interquartile range 1.9-18.7 miles) and 11.7 minutes (interquartile range 3.0-25.7 minutes). The patients in rural areas needed to travel 2 to 3 times farther to see medical and surgical specialists than those living in urban areas. Rural residents with heart disease, cancer, depression, or needing complex cardiac procedures or cancer treatment traveled the farthest. Increasing rurality was also related to decreased visits to specialists and an increasing reliance on generalists.
CONCLUSIONS: Residents of rural areas have increased travel distance and time compared to their urban counterparts. This is particularly true for rural residents with specific diagnoses or those undergoing specific procedures. Our results suggest that most rural residents do not rely on urban areas for much of their care.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To examine the impact of rurality on 30-day preventable readmission, and the illness severity and risk of mortality for 30-day preventable readmissions.
METHODS: We analyzed heart failure Medicare beneficiaries who received home health services for postacute care after hospital discharge in 2009. The study was a cross-sectional design with the unit of analysis as the home health episode for postacute care. Data sources included the following: Medicare Beneficiary Summary File, Medicare Provider Analysis Review, Outcome Assessment Information Set, Home Health Agency Research Identifiable File, and Area Health Resources File. The dependent variables were 30-day preventable readmission, and the extreme/major level of illness severity and of risk of mortality for a 30-day preventable readmission. The key independent variable was rurality defined as remote rural, adjacent rural, and micropolitan areas, with urban areas in the reference group.
FINDINGS: Home health beneficiaries in remote rural areas had 27\% lower 30-day preventable readmission than those in urban areas. Home health beneficiaries in adjacent rural areas were 33\% less likely to have high illness severity at readmission due to a preventable condition than those in urban areas.
CONCLUSIONS: Geographical location affects preventable readmission and illness severity of preventable readmission. Patients' geographic location along with patients' risk factors should be taken into consideration in the risk adjustment model for the financial incentive program that penalizes home health agencies with high preventable readmissions.},

	abstract = {This study determined the extent to which fall risk assessment and management practices for older patients were implemented in Medicare-certified home health agencies (HHAs) in a defined geographic area in southern New England that had participated in evidence-based fall prevention training between October 2001 and September 2004. The standardized in-service training sessions taught home health nurses and rehabilitation therapists how to conduct assessments for five evidence-based risk factors for falls in older adults—mobility impairments, balance disturbances, multiple medications, postural hypotension, and home environmental hazards—using techniques shown to be efficacious in clinical trials. Twenty-six HHAs participated in these in-service training sessions; 19 of these participated in a survey of nurses and rehabilitation therapists between October 2004 and September 2005. Self-reported assessment and management practices implemented with older patients during home healthcare visits were measured in this survey, and HHA-level measures for each fall risk factor were constructed based on proportions of clinicians reporting assessment and management practices that were recommended in the fall prevention training sessions. For all fall risk factors except postural hypotension, 80\% or more of clinicians in all HHAs reported implementing recommended fall risk management practices. Greater variation was found regarding fall risk assessment practices, with fewer than 70\% of clinicians in one or more HHAs reporting recommended assessment practices for all risk factors. Results suggest that evidence-based training for home healthcare clinicians can stimulate fall risk assessment and management practices during home health visits. HHA-level comparisons hold the potential to illustrate the extent of diffusion of evidence-based fall prevention practices within and between agencies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Serious fall injury represents a little studied, yet common and potentially preventable, cause of morbidity and mortality among older persons. We determined the frequency of, and risk factors for, experiencing serious fall injury events among older persons in the community.
SUBJECTS: A representative sample of 1103 community-living persons aged 72 years and older underwent comprehensive baseline and 1-year evaluations.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: During a median 31 months of follow-up, fall data were obtained using fall calendars. Injury data were obtained from telephone interviews and from surveillance of emergency room and hospital records.
RESULTS: At least one fall was experienced by 546 (49\%) participants. A total of 123 participants, representing 23\% of fallers and 12\% of the cohort, experienced 183 serious fall injury events. The factors independently associated with experiencing a serious injury during a fall included cognitive impairment (adjusted odds ratios 2.2; 95\% confidence interval 1.5, 3.2); presence of at least two chronic conditions (2.0; 1.4, 2.9); balance and gait impairment (1.8; 1.3, 2.7); and low body mass index (1.8; 1.2, 2.5). In a separate analysis, including only subjects who fell, female gender (1.8; 1.1, 2.9) as well as most of the above factors were associated with experiencing a fall injury.
CONCLUSIONS: Several readily identifiable factors appeared to distinguish the subgroup of older fallers at risk for suffering a serious fall injury. These factors should help guide who and what to target in prevention efforts.},

Few provide evidence-based suggestions for physicians; however, a consensus conference attempted to identify key roles for the sending and receiving care team (3), and a recent report details best practices for transitional care in managed care organizations and includes programs in which physicians have substantial roles (4).

These programs help hospitalized patients with complex chronic conditions—often the most vulnerable—transfer in a safe and timely manner from one level of care to another or from one type of care setting to another. We conducted a systematic review of the research literature and summarized twenty-one randomized clinical trials of transitional care interventions targeting chronically ill adults. We identified nine interventions that demonstrated positive effects on measures related to hospital readmissions—a key focus of health reform. Most of the interventions led to reductions in readmissions through at least thirty days after discharge. Many of the successful interventions shared similar features, such as assigning a nurse as the clinical manager or leader of care and including in-person home visits to discharged patients. Based on these findings, we recommend several strategies to guide the implementation of transitional care under the Affordable Care Act, such as encouraging the adoption of the most effective interventions through such programs as the Community-Based Care Transitions Program and Medicare shared savings and payment bundling experiments.},

	abstract = {Objectives
The goal of the study was to develop an in-depth understanding of work practices, workflow, and information flow in chronic disease care, to facilitate development of context-appropriate informatics tools.

Design
The study was conducted over a 10-month period in three ambulatory clinics providing chronic disease care. The authors iteratively collected data using direct observation and semi-structured interviews.

Measurements
The authors observed all aspects of care in three different chronic disease clinics for over 150 hours, including 157 patient-provider interactions. Observation focused on interactions among people, processes, and technology. Observation data were analyzed through an open coding approach. The authors then developed models of workflow and information flow using Hierarchical Task Analysis and Soft Systems Methodology. The authors also conducted nine semi-structured interviews to confirm and refine the models.

Results
The study had three primary outcomes: models of workflow for each clinic, models of information flow for each clinic, and an in-depth description of work practices and the role of health information technology (HIT) in the clinics. The authors identified gaps between the existing HIT functionality and the needs of chronic disease providers.

Conclusions
In response to the analysis of workflow and information flow, the authors developed ten guidelines for design of HIT to support chronic disease care, including recommendations to pursue modular approaches to design that would support disease-specific needs. The study demonstrates the importance of evaluating workflow and information flow in HIT design and implementation.},

	abstract = {Background
Healthcare professionals develop workarounds rather than using electronic health record (EHR) systems. Understanding the reasons for workarounds is important to facilitate user-centered design and alignment between work context and available health information technology tools.

Objective
To examine both paper- and computer-based workarounds to the use of EHR systems in three benchmark institutions.

Methods
Qualitative data were collected in 11 primary care outpatient clinics across three healthcare institutions. Data collection methods included direct observation and opportunistic questions. In total, 120 clinic staff and providers and 118 patients were observed. All data were analyzed using previously developed workaround categories and examined for potential new categories. Additionally, workarounds were coded as either paper- or computer-based.

Results
Findings corresponded to 10 of 11 workaround categories identified in previous research. All 10 of these categories applied to paper-based workarounds; five categories also applied to computer-based workarounds. One new category, no correct path (eg, a desired option did not exist in the computer interface, precipitating a workaround), was identified for computer-based workarounds. The most consistent reasons for workarounds across the three institutions were efficiency, memory, and awareness.

Conclusions
Consistent workarounds across institutions suggest common challenges in outpatient clinical settings and failures to accommodate these challenges in EHR design. An examination of workarounds provides insight into how providers adapt to limiting EHR systems. Part of the design process for computer interfaces should include user-centered methods particular to providers and healthcare settings to ensure uptake and usability.},

	abstract = {Objectives: An observational study describes on-duty nurses' informative behaviors from the perspective of library and information science, rather than patient care,. It reveals their information sources, the kinds of information they seek, and their barriers to information acquisition., Methods: Participant observation and in-context interviews were used to record in detail fifty hours of the information behavior of a purposive sample of on-duty critical care nurses on twenty-bed critical care unit in a community hospital. The investigator used rigorous ethnographic methods—including open, in vivo, and axial coding—to analyze the resulting rich textual data., Results: The nurses' information behavior centered on the patient, seeking information from people, the patient record, and other systems. The nurses mostly used patient-specific information, but they also used some social and logistic information. They occasionally sought knowledge-based information. Barriers to information acquisition included illegible handwriting, difficult navigation of online systems, equipment failure, unavailable people, social protocols, and mistakes caused by people multitasking while working with multiple complex systems. Although the participating nurses understood and respected evidence-based practice, many believed that taking time to read published information on duty was not only difficult, but perhaps also ethically wrong. They said that a personal information service available to them at all hours of the day or night would be very useful., Conclusions: On-duty critical care nursing is a patient-centric information activity. A major implication of this study for librarians is that immediate professional reference service—including quality and quantity filtering—may be more useful to on-duty nurses than do-it-yourself searching and traditional document delivery are.},

Yet, little is known about the meanings children themselves give to their own consumption. Drawing from an ethnographic study of children aged 6-11 years and their families, the paper presents girls' constructions of fashion in relation to their own bodies and to those of others. It is shown that although girls may both desire and actually 'dress up' in fashionable clothing, they present a range of contingent and contradictory meanings for doing so. For some girls, 'dressing up' in certain clothes may be a way of 'ageing up' toward feminine adulthood, albeit in restricted contexts and after negotiations between themselves and their parents as to what can be worn and where. Nonetheless, girls in the study also showed anxieties and disapproval of 'showing the body' through 'revealing' clothing. The article concludes by considering the implication of these findings for debates about gendered childhoods, and intergenerational relations in late modern consumer society.},

	abstract = {This study explores the relationship between body image and identity development in a sample of 53 college students (mean = 26.45 years; s.d. = 7.36). College is an environment that promotes identity development, but it is also a time when many students face a heightened risk for weight gain, which could affect their body image. Previous studies have demonstrated relationships between body image and identity status. The purpose of this study was to build on that research by exploring the role of identity distress in the relationship between body image and identity status. It was hypothesized that those individuals who met for a DSMIV diagnosis of identity problem would exhibit more anxiety about their body image, and that identity distress would be a better predictor of body image than identity status alone. In this cross sectional study, participants in the moratorium identity status scored significantly higher on overweight preoccupation than those in the foreclosed identity status. Males had a significantly higher evaluation of their appearance than women did. Those who met DSM IV diagnosis for identity problem scored significantly lower in health orientation and body areas satisfaction. Identity distress was a significant predictor of appearance evaluation, body areas satisfaction, and overweight preoccupation, while a foreclosed identity status was a significant predictor of fitness orientation. Implications for intervention and prevention programs are discussed. (English)},

	abstract = {According to the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA, 2005), 10 million women and one million men struggle with eating disorders, including anorexia and bulimia. Disordered eating is most common in adolescent girls ages 15-19 and is prevalent in a diverse range of populations (NEDA, 2005). For example, African-American girls aged 11-14 engage in more behaviors commonly associated with disordered eating than Caucasian girls of the same age (NEDA, 2005), and 28\% of Native American teenage girls in grades 7-12 reported purging behavior while 48.3\% admitted to dieting (Story et al., 1997). One common explanation for disordered eating is exposure to thinness depicting and promoting (TDP) media, which showcase and endorse slender individuals, resulting in distorted or negative body image perceptions among female adolescents and college women (Bell \& Dittmar, 2011; Harrison, 2000; Myers \& Biocca, 1992; Silverstein, Perdue, Peterson, \& Kelly, 1986). These distorted or negative body images are problematic because exposure to such "thin-ideal" media may lead to disordered eating (Bissell \& Zhou, 2004; Harrison, 2000), among other problems. One prominent TDP media are teen fashion magazines (e.g., "Teen Vogue," "Seventeen," and "Glamour"), which depict slender models that increase women's drive for thinness (Cohen, 2006). These magazines are particularly influential because they target an audience in which disordered eating is most common, and display models that are thinner than 98\% of American women (NEDA, 2005). Further, Harrison (2000) found that for females, exposure to TDP magazine content positively predicted anorexia. She also reported that for 9th and 12th grade females, exposure to thin-ideal magazine content was a positive predictor of bulimia. Her research findings are in accordance with Tiggerman (2003), who found that reading fashion magazines was correlated positively with internalizing the thin ideal. This activity is designed to challenge gender and communication students to develop ways to combat TDP media by having students create a teen fashion magazine that promotes healthy and authentic body images of women. This assignment allows students to consider how a hypothetical editor may design a popular magazine that provides women with an attainable and healthy social comparison. A list of references and suggested readings is included.},

It does so by addressing issues such as the processes related to comprehension of medical information, clinical problem-solving and decision-making, and the role of technology. This paper reviews these theories and methods from the cognitive and learning sciences and their role in addressing current and future needs in designing curricula, largely using illustrative examples drawn from medical education. The lessons of this past work are also applicable, however, to biomedical and health professional curricula in general, and to biomedical informatics training, in particular. We summarize empirical studies conducted over two decades on the role of memory, knowledge organization and reasoning as well as studies of problem-solving and decision-making in medical areas that inform curricular design. The results of this research contribute to the design of more informed curricula based on empirical findings about how people learn and think, and more specifically, how expertise is developed. Similarly, the study of practice can also help to shape theories of human performance, technology-based learning, and scientific and professional collaboration that extend beyond the domain of medicine. Just as biomedical science has revolutionized health care practice, research in the cognitive and learning sciences provides a scientific foundation for education in biomedicine, the health professions, and biomedical informatics.},

	abstract = {Purposes
This study aimed to compare between electronic medication administration records and paper-based records in the nursing time spent on various activities in a medication round and the medication administration processes followed by nurses in an Australian residential aged care home. It also aimed to identify the benefits and unintended adverse consequences of using the electronic medication administration records.
Methods
Time–motion observation, taking of field notes, informal conversation and document review were used to collect data in two units of a residential aged care home. Each unit had one nurse administer medication. Seven nurses were observed over 12 morning shifts. Unit 1 used electronic medication administration records and Unit 2 used paper-based records.
Results
No significant difference between the two units was found in the nursing time spent on various activities in a medication round, including documentation, verbal communication, medication administration, infection control and transit.
Comparison of the medication administration processes between the electronic and paper-based medication administration records identified a procedural problem which violated the organization's documentation requirement. This problem was documenting before providing medication to a resident when using the paper-based records. It was not observed with the electronic medication administration records.
Benefits of introducing the electronic medication administration records included improving nurses’ compliance with documentation requirements, freedom from the error of signing twice, reducing the possibility of forgetting to medicate a resident, facilitating nurses to record the time of medication administration to a resident and increasing documentation space. Unintended adverse consequences of introducing the electronic medication administration records included inadequate information about residents, late addition of a new resident's medication profile in the records and nurses’ forgetting to medicate a resident due to power outage of the portable device.
Conclusions
The electronic medication administration records may not change nursing time spent on various activities in a medication round or substantially alter the medication administration processes, but can generate both benefits and unintended adverse consequences. Future research may investigate whether and how the adverse consequences can be prevented.},

Method
A prospective descriptive design was used. In total 287 hospital nurses and 220 home care nurses were asked to complete a questionnaire before and after the hospital implemented nursing documentation integrated in the electronic patient record (EPR).
Results
Discrepancies between the policies expressed by the health care organizations and the authorities in formal documents and the information management used by the nurses were identified. Differences were also found between nurses in hospital and home care with regard to how they assessed the information management during patient admission, throughout the patient's hospital stay and at the patient's discharge. The perceived differences decreased, however, after the hospital introduced electronic nursing documentation. The study shows a need to contextualize and customize the information that nurses exchange. In addition technological problems with the lack of integrated EPR systems between the hospital and the home health care as well as different practice models in the two organizations entail complex information handling during a patient's trajectory through the health system.},

	abstract = {Objectives
To conduct a review of reviews on the impacts and costs of telemedicine services. Methods
A review of systematic reviews of telemedicine interventions was conducted. Interventions included all e-health interventions, information and communication technologies for communication in health care, Internet based interventions for diagnosis and treatments, and social care if important part of health care and in collaboration with health care for patients with chronic conditions were considered relevant. Each potentially relevant systematic review was assessed in full text by one member of an external expert team, using a revised check list from EPOC (Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group) to assess quality. Qualitative analysis of the included reviews was informed by principles of realist review.
Results
In total 1593 titles/abstracts were identified. Following quality assessment, the review included 80 heterogeneous systematic reviews. Twenty-one reviews concluded that telemedicine is effective, 18 found that evidence is promising but incomplete and others that evidence is limited and inconsistent. Emerging themes are the particularly problematic nature of economic analyses of telemedicine, the benefits of telemedicine for patients, and telemedicine as complex and ongoing collaborative achievements in unpredictable processes.
Conclusions
The emergence of new topic areas in this dynamic field is notable and reviewers are starting to explore new questions beyond those of clinical and cost-effectiveness. Reviewers point to a continuing need for larger studies of telemedicine as controlled interventions, and more focus on patients’ perspectives, economic analyses and on telemedicine innovations as complex processes and ongoing collaborative achievements. Formative assessments are emerging as an area of interest.},

	abstract = {Context Organized care management processes (CMPs) can improve health care quality
for patients with chronic diseases. The Institute of Medicine of the National
Academy of Sciences has called for public and private purchasers of health
care to create incentives for physician organizations (POs) to use CMPs and
for the government to assist POs in implementing information technology (IT)
to facilitate CMP use. Research is lacking about the extent to which POs use
CMPs or about the degree to which incentives, IT, or other factors are associated
with their use.Objectives To determine the extent to which POs with 20 or more physicians use
CMPs and to identify key factors associated with CMP use for 4 chronic diseases
(asthma, congestive heart failure, depression, and diabetes).Design, Setting, and Participants One thousand five hundred eighty-seven US POs (medical groups and independent
practice associations) with 20 or more physicians were identified using 5
large databases. One thousand one hundred four of these POs (70\%) agreed to
participate in a telephone survey conducted between September 2000 and September
2001. Sixty-four responding POs were excluded because they did not treat any
of the 4 diseases, leaving 1040 POs.Main Outcome Measures Extent of use of CMPs as calculated on the basis of a summary measure,
a PO care management index (POCMI; range, 0-6) and factors associated with
CMP use.Results Physician organizations' mean use of CMPs was 5.1 of a possible 16;
50\% used 4 or fewer. External incentives and clinical IT were most strongly
associated with CMP use. Controlling for other factors, use of the 2 most
strongly associated incentives—public recognition and better contracts
for health care quality—was associated with use of 1.3 and 0.7 additional
CMPs, respectively (P{\textless}.001 and P = .007). Each additional IT capability was associated with 0.37 additional
CMPs (P{\textless}.001). However, 33\% of POs reported no
external incentives and 50\% reported no clinical IT capability.Conclusions The use of CMPs varies greatly among POs, but it is low on average.
Government and private purchasers of health care may increase CMP use by providing
external incentives for improvement of health care quality to POs and by assisting
them in improving their clinical IT capability.},

health and health care delivery, but it is not clear how prevalent Internet
use for health care really is or what impact it has on health care utilization.
Available estimates of use and impact vary widely. Without accurate estimates
of use and effects, it is difficult to focus policy discussions or design
appropriate policy activities.Objectives To measure the extent of Internet use for health care among a representative
sample of the US population, to examine the prevalence of e-mail use for health
care, and to examine the effects that Internet and e-mail use has on users'
knowledge about health care matters and their use of the health care system.Design, Setting, and Participants Survey conducted in December 2001 and January 2002 among a sample drawn
from a research panel of more than 60 000 US households developed and
maintained by Knowledge Networks. Responses were analyzed from 4764 individuals
aged 21 years or older who were self-reported Internet users.Main Outcome Measures Self-reported rates in the past year of Internet and e-mail use to obtain
information related to health, contact health care professionals, and obtain
prescriptions; perceived effects of Internet and e-mail use on health care
use.Results Approximately 40\% of respondents with Internet access reported using
the Internet to look for advice or information about health or health care
in 2001. Six percent reported using e-mail to contact a physician or other
health care professional. About one third of those using the Internet for
health reported that using the Internet affected a decision about health or
their health care, but very few reported impacts on measurable health care
utilization; 94\% said that Internet use had no effect on the number of physician
visits they had and 93\% said it had no effect on the number of telephone contacts.
Five percent or less reported use of the Internet to obtain prescriptions
or purchase pharmaceutical products.Conclusions Although many people use the Internet for health information, use is
not as common as is sometimes reported. Effects on actual health care utilization
are also less substantial than some have claimed. Discussions of the role
of the Internet in health care and the development of policies that might
influence this role should not presume that use of the Internet for health
information is universal or that the Internet strongly influences health care
utilization.},

The authors describe the kinds of silent errors they have witnessed and, from their different social science perspectives (information science, sociology, and cognitive science), they interpret the nature of these errors. The errors fall into two main categories: those in the process of entering and retrieving information, and those in the communication and coordination process that the PCIS is supposed to support.

	abstract = {SummaryBackground and purpose
The generalised assumption of health information systems (HIS) success is questioned by a few commentators in the medical informatics field. They point to widespread HIS failure. The purpose of this paper was therefore to develop a better conceptual foundation for, and practical guidance on, health information systems failure (and success).
Methods
Literature and case analysis plus pilot testing of developed model.
Results
Defining HIS failure and success is complex, and the current evidence base on HIS success and failure rates was found to be weak. Nonetheless, the best current estimate is that HIS failure is an important problem. The paper therefore derives and explains the “design–reality gap” conceptual model. This is shown to be robust in explaining multiple cases of HIS success and failure, yet provides a contingency that encompasses the differences which exist in different HIS contexts. The design–reality gap model is piloted to demonstrate its value as a tool for risk assessment and mitigation on HIS projects. It also throws into question traditional, structured development methodologies, highlighting the importance of emergent change and improvisation in HIS.
Conclusions
The design–reality gap model can be used to address the problem of HIS failure, both as a post hoc evaluative tool and as a pre hoc risk assessment and mitigation tool. It also validates a set of methods, techniques, roles and competencies needed to support the dynamic improvisations that are found to underpin cases of HIS success.},

Patient portals can help with information sharing, but concerns about privacy and autonomy of elderly patients remain. Health systems that implement patient portals would benefit from guidance about how best to implement access to portals for caregivers of elderly patients.
OBJECTIVE: To identify how patients older than 75 years (hereinafter, elders) and family caregivers of such patients approach sharing of health information, with the hope of applying the results to collaborative patient portals.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A qualitative study was conducted from October 20, 2013, to February 16, 2014, inviting participants older than 75 years (n = 30) and participants who assist a family member older than 75 years (n = 23) to 1 of 10 discussion groups. Participants were drawn from the Information Sharing Across Generations (InfoSAGE) Living Laboratory, an ongoing study of information needs of elders and families based within an academically affiliated network of senior housing in metropolitan Boston, Massachusetts. Groups were separated into elders and caregivers to allow for more detailed discussion. A professional moderator led groups using a discussion guide. Group discussions were audiotaped, transcribed, and analyzed inductively using immersion/crystallization methods for central themes.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Central themes regarding sharing of health information between elderly patients and family caregivers.
RESULTS: Seven lessons emerged from 2 main themes. First, sharing information has consequences: (1) elders and caregivers have different perspectives on what is seen as the "burden" of information, (2) access to medical information by families can have unintended consequences, and (3) elders do not want to feel "spied on" by family. Second, control of information sharing is dynamic: (4) elders wish to retain control of decision making as long as possible, (5) transfer of control occurs gradually depending on elders' health and functional status, (6) control of information sharing and decision making should be fluid to maximize elders' autonomy, and (7) no "one-size-fits-all" approach can satisfy individuals' different preferences.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Information sharing and control are complex issues even under the most well-meaning circumstances. While elders may delegate control and share information with family, they want to retain granular control of their information. When using patient portals, simple proxy access may not adequately address the needs and concerns of aging patients.},

	abstract = {Objective
Healthcare reforms in the United States, including the Affordable Care and HITECH Acts, and the NCQA criteria for the Patient Centered Medical Home have promoted health information technology (HIT) and the integration of general medical and mental health services. These developments, which aim to improve chronic disease care have largely occurred in parallel, with little attention to the need for coordination. In this article, the fundamental connections between HIT and improvements in chronic disease management are explored. We use the evidence-based collaborative care model as an example, with attention to health literacy improvement for supporting patient engagement in care.

Method
A review of the literature was conducted to identify how HIT and collaborative care, an evidence-based model of chronic disease care, support each other.

Results
Five key principles of effective collaborative care are outlined: care is patient-centered, evidence-based, measurement-based, population-based, and accountable. The potential role of HIT in implementing each principle is discussed. Key features of the mobile health paradigm are described, including how they can extend evidence-based treatment beyond traditional clinical settings.

Conclusion
HIT, and particularly mobile health, can enhance collaborative care interventions, and thus improve the health of individuals and populations when deployed in integrated delivery systems.},

	abstract = {Background
Electronic health information platforms have the potential to support standardized care delivery models, engage patients, and deliver patient self-assessment tools.
Study Design
We tested whether an e-health platform could support the delivery and acquisition of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) during hospitalization after cardiac surgery. Secondarily, we tested if patient reported data were predictive of resource use (length of stay) or outcomes (discharge disposition). Subjects were 149 cardiac surgical patients, over age 50 years, undergoing routine surgery, with an expected length of stay of 5 to 7 days. While hospitalized, patients were provided with iPads (Apple), which delivered a personalized care plan. That plan included daily patient “To Do” lists with self-assessment modules that included recovery-related patient reported outcomes. Those included an early screen for discharge planning (ESDP) as well as daily pain and mobility self-assessments using the visual analog pain scale and the I-MOVE mobility scale. We measured completion rates for the self assessments, determined length of stay (short, intermediate, or long) and discharge disposition (home independently or other), and evaluated whether patient self-assessments were predictive of these outcomes.
Results
Patients completed 98\% of the 1,418 self-assessments that were delivered. The ESDP and mobility self-assessments were predictive of length of hospital stay (p = 0.004 and p = 0.012, respectively) and of discharge disposition (p \&lt; 0.0001 and p \&lt; 0.007, respectively). Lower ESDP scores and higher I-MOVE scores were predictive of shorter lengths of stay and a higher likelihood of discharge to home independently.
Conclusions
Our trial demonstrated that an e-health platform, combined with mobile computing, can effectively deliver customized care plans with which patients can interact. Furthermore, patient self-reported data are predictive of length of stay and discharge disposition.},

	abstract = {Background: Advancements in information technology (IT) and its increasingly ubiquitous nature expand the ability to engage patients in the health care process and motivate health behavior change. Objective: Our aim was to systematically review the (1) impact of IT platforms used to promote patients\&\#8217; engagement and to effect change in health behaviors and health outcomes, (2) behavior theories or models applied as bases for developing these interventions and their impact on health outcomes, (3) different ways of measuring health outcomes, (4) usability, feasibility, and acceptability of these technologies among patients, and (5) challenges and research directions for implementing IT platforms to meaningfully impact patient engagement and health outcomes. Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar were searched for studies published from 2000 to December 2014. Two reviewers assessed the quality of the included papers, and potentially relevant studies were retrieved and assessed for eligibility based on predetermined inclusion criteria. Results: A total of 170 articles met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed in detail. Overall, 88.8\% (151/170) of studies showed positive impact on patient behavior and 82.9\% (141/170) reported high levels of improvement in patient engagement. Only 47.1\% (80/170) referenced specific behavior theories and only 33.5\% (57/170) assessed the usability of IT platforms. The majority of studies used indirect ways to measure health outcomes (65.9\%, 112/170). Conclusions: In general, the review has shown that IT platforms can enhance patient engagement and improve health outcomes. Few studies addressed usability of these interventions, and the reason for not using specific behavior theories remains unclear. Further research is needed to clarify these important questions. In addition, an assessment of these types of interventions should be conducted based on a common framework using a large variety of measurements; these measurements should include those related to motivation for health behavior change, long-standing adherence, expenditure, satisfaction, and health outcomes.

	abstract = {Background
The proportion of older adults in the population is steadily increasing, causing healthcare costs to rise dramatically. This situation calls for the implementation of health-related information and communication technologies (ICT) to assist in providing more cost-effective healthcare to the elderly. In order for such a measure to succeed, older adults must be prepared to adopt these technologies. Prior research shows, however, that this population lags behind in ICT adoption, although some believe that this is a temporary phenomenon that will soon change.
Objectives
To assess use by older adults of technology in general and ICT in particular, in order to evaluate their readiness to adopt health-related ICT.
Method
We employed the questionnaire used by Selwyn et al. in 2000 in the UK, as well as a survey instrument used by Morris and Venkatesh, to examine the validity of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) in the context of computer use by older employees. 123 respondents answered the questions via face-to-face interviews, 63 from the US and 60 from Israel. SPSS 17.0 was used for the data analysis.
Results
The results show that although there has been some increase in adoption of modern technologies, including ICT, most of the barriers found by Selwyn et al. are still valid. ICT use was determined by accessibility of computers and support and by age, marital status, education, and health. Health, however, was found to moderate the effect of age, healthier older people being far more likely to use computers than their unhealthy coevals. The TPB was only partially supported, since only perceived behavioral control (PBC) emerged as significantly affecting intention to use a computer, while age, contrary to the findings of Morris and Venkatesh, interacted differently for Americans and Israelis. The main reason for non-use was ‘no interest’ or ‘no need’, similar to findings from data collected in 2000.
Conclusions
Adoption of technology by older adults is still limited, though it has increased as compared with results of the previous study. Modern technologies have been adopted (albeit selectively) by older users, who were presumably strongly motivated by perceived usefulness. Particularly worrying are the effects of health, PBC, and the fact that many older adults do not share the perception that ICT can significantly improve their quality of life. We therefore maintain that older adults are not yet ready to adopt health-related ICT. Health-related ICT for the elderly should be kept simple and demonstrate substantial benefits, and special attention should be paid to training and support and to specific personal and cultural characteristics. These are mandatory conditions for adoption by potential unhealthy and older consumers.},

	abstract = {Purpose
To provide an overview of factors influencing the acceptance of electronic technologies that support aging in place by community-dwelling older adults. Since technology acceptance factors fluctuate over time, a distinction was made between factors in the pre-implementation stage and factors in the post-implementation stage.
Methods
A systematic review of mixed studies. Seven major scientific databases (including MEDLINE, Scopus and CINAHL) were searched. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) original and peer-reviewed research, (2) qualitative, quantitative or mixed methods research, (3) research in which participants are community-dwelling older adults aged 60 years or older, and (4) research aimed at investigating factors that influence the intention to use or the actual use of electronic technology for aging in place. Three researchers each read the articles and extracted factors.
Results
Sixteen out of 2841 articles were included. Most articles investigated acceptance of technology that enhances safety or provides social interaction. The majority of data was based on qualitative research investigating factors in the pre-implementation stage. Acceptance in this stage is influenced by 27 factors, divided into six themes: concerns regarding technology (e.g., high cost, privacy implications and usability factors); expected benefits of technology (e.g., increased safety and perceived usefulness); need for technology (e.g., perceived need and subjective health status); alternatives to technology (e.g., help by family or spouse), social influence (e.g., influence of family, friends and professional caregivers); and characteristics of older adults (e.g., desire to age in place). When comparing these results to qualitative results on post-implementation acceptance, our analysis showed that some factors are persistent while new factors also emerge. Quantitative results showed that a small number of variables have a significant influence in the pre-implementation stage. Fourteen out of the sixteen included articles did not use an existing technology acceptance framework or model.
Conclusions
Acceptance of technology in the pre-implementation stage is influenced by multiple factors. However, post-implementation research on technology acceptance by community-dwelling older adults is scarce and most of the factors in this review have not been tested by using quantitative methods. Further research is needed to determine if and how the factors in this review are interrelated, and how they relate to existing models of technology acceptance.},

	abstract = {Over the past decades, many robots for the elderly have been developed, supporting different activities of elderly people. A systematic review in four scientific literature databases and a search in article references and European projects was performed in order to create an overview of robots supporting independent living of elderly people. The robots found were categorized based on their development stage, the activity domains they claim to support, and the type of support provided (i.e., physical, non-physical, and/or non-specified). In total, 107 robots for the elderly were identified. Six robots were still in a concept phase, 95 in a development phase, and six of these robots were commercially available. These robots claimed to provide support related to four activity domains: mobility, self-care, interpersonal interaction \& relationships, and other activities. Of the many robots developed, only a small percentage is commercially available. Technical ambitions seem to be guiding robot development. To prolong independent living, the step towards physical support is inevitable and needs to be taken. However, it will be a long time before a robot will be capable of supporting multiple activities in a physical manner in the home of an elderly person in order to enhance their independent living.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE OF STUDY: The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which patients discharged "home to self care" experienced problems and unmet needs. A secondary aim was to explore potential differences in problems and unmet needs between medical and surgical patients.
PRIMARY PRACTICE SETTING: The study setting was acute care in 2 hospitals that were part of a large academic medical center in the Midwest.
METHODOLOGY AND SAMPLE: The prospective, cohort survey study was designed with a systematic sampling strategy to identify 130 cognitively intact adults hospitalized for either medical or surgical reasons who planned to return home after discharge without formal community services. The hospital information system was checked daily to verify whether dispositions were coded "home to self care," and to verify whether the patients were not seen by a discharge planner. The Problems After Discharge Questionnaire-English Version (PADQ-E) was then either mailed or administered via a phone interview approximately 1 week after discharge.
RESULTS: Overall, 73.8\% wanted more information about one or more topics related to their care. Most frequently mentioned were "when they would be completely recovered" (38.0\%) and "where and how they could get nursing care at home if they needed it" (36.9\%). A majority (91.8\%) reported difficulties related to at least 1 physical complaint. Pain was most frequently mentioned by surgical patients (88.1\%). Getting tired quickly was an issue for both surgical (76.2\%) and medical patients (62.8\%). More than 85\% received help at home from family or friends. Surgical patients received significantly more assistance than medical patients with personal care, household activities, and mobility. Approximately 1 in 4 surgical patients reported an unmet need within the Physical Complaints subscale on the PADQ-E.
IMPLICATIONS FOR CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE: Potential problems that may occur after discharge have little chance of getting addressed if not identified during the discharge planning process. Standardized, early screening to accurately identify patients at risk for unmet needs after discharge is critical to the development and implementation of a quality discharge plan. The lack of time available to hospital clinicians to assemble and interpret extensive and complex information calls for improved methods to support identifying patients at risk for poor outcomes, engaging discharge planners efficiently and accurately, providing a standardized assessment to identify and address continuing care needs, and identifying patients who would benefit from post-acute care. Case managers advance their practice by advocating for and participating in the development of improved methods.},

This paper presents findings from a study which investigated the influence of several factors on the social dimension of alignment within 10 business units in the Canadian life insurance industry. The social dimension of alignment refers to the state in which business and IT executives understand and are committed to the business and IT mission, objectives, and plans. The research model included four factors that would potentially influence alignment: (1) shared domain knowledge between business and IT executives, (2) IT implementation success, (3) communication between business and IT executives, and (4) connections between business and IT planning processes. The outcome, alignment, was operationalized in two ways: the degree of mutual understanding of current objectives (short-term alignment) and the congruence of IT vision (long-term alignment) between business and IT executives. A total of 57 semi-structured interviews were held with 45 informants. Written business and IT strategic plans, minutes from IT steering committee meetings, and other strategy documents were collected and analyzed from each of the 10 business units. All four factors in the model (shared domain knowledge, IT implementation success, communication between business and IT executives, and connections between business and IT planning) were found to influence short-term alignment. Only shared domain knowledge was found to influence long-term alignment. A new factor, strategic business plans, was found to influence both short and long-term alignment. The findings suggest that both practitioners and researchers should direct significant effort toward understanding shared domain knowledge, the factor which had the strongest influence on the alignment between IT and business executives. There is also a call for further research into the creation of an IT vision.},

	abstract = {Even after a decade of research and discussion, strategic alignment, denoting the fit between information technology (IT) and business strategy, remains an enduring challenge for firms worldwide. In this paper, we go beyond the dominant firm-level alignment paradigm by utilizing a value disciplines perspective on strategic foci to conceptualize alignment at the process level. Theory would then suggest that alignment should be tightest in processes that are considered critical to each firm's strategic focus. Using data from matched surveys of IT and business executives at 241 firms, we detect support for this locus of alignment argument when alignment is identified using profile deviation or moderation. We also find a positive link between alignment and perceived IT business value in each of five primary processes in the value chain. By bringing a process-level view to the study of alignment and its impacts, we go beyond a discussion on the extent of fit—a cornerstone of the literature—to whether firms are pursuing the right type of fit for the particular mix of processes underlying their strategy. In this way, a process-level perspective can foster a deeper and more meaningful understanding of how alignment affects firm performance. Our results also show a need for managers to reconsider the steps taken to align IT and business strategy by looking more closely at how IT can support individual processes rather than at how IT can support an entire strategy.},

However, detailed case studies on container terminal operators showed very different patterns; this suggested that successful alignment of IT in industries which are highly IT-dependent would require very different perspectives of both IT and business managers although these are still convergent within the organisation.},

	abstract = {Between July 2003 and December 2007, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) introduced a national home telehealth program, Care Coordination/Home Telehealth (CCHT). Its purpose was to coordinate the care of veteran patients with chronic conditions and avoid their unnecessary admission to long-term institutional care. Demographic changes in the veteran population necessitate VHA increase its noninstitutional care (NIC) services 100\% above its 2007 level to provide care for 110,000 NIC patients by 2011. By 2011, CCHT will meet 50\% of VHA’s anticipated NIC provision. CCHT involves the systematic implementation of health informatics, home telehealth, and disease management technologies. It helps patients live independently at home. Between 2003 and 2007, the census figure (point prevalence) for VHA CCHT patients increased from 2,000 to 31,570 (1,500\% growth). CCHT is now a routine NIC service provided by VHA to support veteran patients with chronic conditions as they age. CCHT patients are predominantly male (95\%) and aged 65 years or older. Strict criteria determine patient eligibility for enrollment into the program and VHA internally assesses how well its CCHT programs meet standardized clinical, technology, and managerial requirements. VHA has trained 5,000 staff to provide CCHT. Routine analysis of data obtained for quality and performance purposes from a cohort of 17,025 CCHT patients shows the benefits of a 25\% reduction in numbers of bed days of care, 19\% reduction in numbers of hospital admissions, and mean satisfaction score rating of 86\% after enrollment into the program. The cost of CCHT is \$1,600 per patient per annum, substantially less than other NIC programs and nursing home care. VHA’s experience is that an enterprise-wide home telehealth implementation is an appropriate and cost-effective way of managing chronic care patients in both urban and rural settings.},

After critically examining the very notions of ‘success’ and ‘failure’, and after discussing the problematic nature of lists of ‘critical success- or failure factors’, this paper discusses three myths that often hamper implementation processes. Alternative insights are presented, and illustrated with concrete examples. First of all, the implementation of a PCIS is a process of mutual transformation; the organization and the technology transform each other during the implementation process. When this is foreseen, PCIS implementations can be intended strategically to help transform the organization. Second, such a process can only get off the ground when properly supported by both central management and future users. A top down framework for the implementation is crucial to turn user-input into a coherent steering force, creating a solid basis for organizational transformation. Finally, the management of IS implementation processes is a careful balancing act between initiating organizational change, and drawing upon IS as a change agent, without attempting to pre-specify and control this process. Accepting, and even drawing upon, this inevitable uncertainty might be the hardest lesson to learn.},

Evidence from this study and findings from the more problematic USA implementation case suggests that key factors for cost effective implementation and operation were features of the system itself, the implementation process and the conditions under which the implementation was carried out.Conclusion There is empirical support for the IT implementation theory developed in this study, which provides a sound basis for future research and successful implementation. Successful implementation of an EMR is likely with an intuitive system, requiring little training, already well developed for clinical work but allowing flexibility for development, where clinicians are involved in selection and in modification for their department needs and where a realistic timetable is made using an assessment of the change-capability of the organization. Once a system decision is made, the implementation should be driven by top and departmental leaders assisted by competent project teams involving information technology specialists and users. Corrections for unforeseen eventualities will be needed, especially with less developed systems, requiring regular reviews of progress and modifications to systems and timetables to respond to user needs.},

This paper contributes to this emerging body of knowledge by applying Actor-Network Theory (ANT) to explore the implementation of a radiology network system in a Swedish hospital. The analysis of the process reveals how complex contextual dynamics had disruptive effects. First, we identified important dynamics related to implementation content; these were mainly expressed as tensions between the radiology network system and medical work practices. Second, we found important dynamics related to implementation context; these were mainly expressed as tensions between shifting networks of actors within the implementation project and the broader institutional setting. Seeking to understand contextual dynamics during healthcare information systems implementation, we use events to focus, structure, and present the ANT analysis. This event-based approach furthers our understanding of how researchers can apply ANT to study IT-based change in general.},

	abstract = {Summary
In 1984, Peter Reichertz gave a lecture on the past, present and future of hospital information systems. In the meantime, there has been a tremendous progress in medicine as well as in informatics. One important benefit of this progress is that our life expectancy is nowadays significantly higher than it would have been even some few decades ago. This progress, leading to aging societies, is of influence to the organization of health care and to the future development of its information systems. Twenty years later, referring to Peter Reichertz’ lecture, but now considering health information systems (HIS), two questions are discussed: which were lines of development in health information systems from the past until today? What are consequences for health information systems in the future?

The following lines of development for HIS were considered as important: (1) the shift from paper-based to computer-based processing and storage, as well as the increase of data in health care settings; (2) the shift from institution-centered departmental and, later, hospital information systems towards regional and global HIS; (3) the inclusion of patients and health consumers as HIS users, besides health care professionals and administrators; (4) the use of HIS data not only for patient care and administrative purposes, but also for health care planning as well as clinical and epidemiological research; (5) the shift from focusing mainly on technical HIS problems to those of change management as well as of strategic information management; (6) the shift from mainly alpha-numeric data in HIS to images and now also to data on the molecular level; (7) the steady increase of new technologies to be included, now starting to include ubiquitous computing environments and sensor-based technologies for health monitoring.

As consequences for HIS in the future, first the need for institutional and (inter-) national HIS-strategies is seen, second the need to explore new (transinstitutional) HIS architectural styles, third the need for education in health informatics and/or biomedical informatics, including appropriate knowledge and skills on HIS. As these new HIS are urgently needed for reorganizing health care in an aging society, as last consequence the need for research around HIS is seen. Research should include the development and investigation of appropriate transinstitutional information system architectures, of adequate methods for strategic information management, of methods for modeling and evaluating HIS, the development and investigation of comprehensive electronic patient records, providing appropriate access for health care professionals as well as for patients, in the broad sense as described here, e.g. including home care and health monitoring facilities.

Comparing the world in 1984 and in 2004, we have to recognize that we imperceptibly, stepwise arrived at a new world. HIS have become one of the most challenging and promising fields of research, education and practice for medical informatics, with significant benefits to medicine and health care in general.},

Multivariate techniques were used to evaluate the relationship between the set of six organizational factors and two measures of innovation diffusion.Measurements: A Guttman-like scale was developed to measure infusion, or depth or sophistication, of each of the three innovations at each institution. Diffusion was measured by a question previously developed for another study. Six independent variables were measured via five formerly developed scales and one new one.Results: The overall response rate was 41\%. The set of organizational variables produced significant results in the diffusion of each of the three innovations, with individual variables influencing diffusion to varying degrees. The same set produced significant results in relation to infusion only for online searching. There was little or no correlation between infusion and diffusion for each innovation.Conclusion: Organizational attributes are important predictors for diffusion of information technology innovations. Individual variables differ in their effect on each innovation. The set of attributes seems less able to predict infusion. It is recommended that both infusion and diffusion be measured in future studies because there is little relation between them. It is further recommended that individuals charged with implementing information technology in the health sciences receive training in managing organizational issues.},

	abstract = {The adoption of health information systems is seen world wide as one method to mitigate the widening health care demand and supply gap. The purpose of this review was to identify the current state of knowledge about health information systems adoption in primary care. The goal was to understand factors and influencers affecting implementation outcomes from previous health information systems implementations experiences. A comprehensive systematic literature review of peer reviewed and grey literature was undertaken to identify the current state of knowledge regarding the implementation of health information systems. A total of 6 databases, 27 journal websites, 20 websites from grey sources, 9 websites from medical colleges and professional associations as well as 22 government/commission websites were searched. The searches returned almost 3700 article titles. Eighty-six articles met our inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Articles show that systems’ graphical user interface design quality, feature functionality, project management, procurement and users’ previous experience affect implementation outcomes. Implementers had concerns about factors such as privacy, patient safety, provider/patient relations, staff anxiety, time factors, quality of care, finances, efficiency, and liability. The review showed that implementers can insulate the project from such concerns by establishing strong leadership, using project management techniques, establishing standards and training their staff to ensure such risks do not compromise implementation success. The review revealed the concept of socio-technical factors, or “fit” factors, that complicate health information systems deployment. The socio-technical perspective considers how the technical features of a health information system interact with the social features of a health care work environment.

The review showed that quality of care, patient safety and provider/patient relations were not, positively or negatively, affected by systems implementation. The fact that no articles were found reviewing the benefits or drawbacks of health information systems accruing to patients should be concern to adopters, payers and jurisdictions. No studies were found that compared how provider–patient interactions in interviews are effected when providers used electronic health information systems as opposed to the paper equivalent. Very little information was available about privacy and liability.},

	abstract = {Background: Older adults are the most frequent and heaviest users of health services in the United States; however, previous research on older adults\&\#8217; use of health information technology (HIT) has not examined the possible association of HIT use among older adults with their use of health services. Objective: This study examined the relationship between US older adults\&\#8217; use of health services and their use of the Internet for health-related activities, controlling for socioeconomic characteristics and aging-related limitations in sensory and cognitive function. It also examined gender differences in the pattern of association between the types of health services used and HIT use. Methods: The data for this study were drawn from the 2009 US National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), which was the first nationally representative household survey to collect data on HIT (Internet) use. First, the rates of lifetime and 12-month HIT use among sample adults (n = 27,731) by age group (18-29 to 85 and over) were analyzed. Second, bivariate analysis of sociodemographic characteristics, health status, and health service use by HIT use status among those aged 65 or older (n = 5294) was conducted. Finally, multivariate binary logistic regression analysis was used to test the study hypotheses with 12-month HIT use as the dependent variable and 12-month health service uses among the age group 65 or older as possible correlates. Results: The rates of HIT use were significantly lower among the age groups 65 or older compared with the younger age groups, although the age group 55 to 64 was not different from those younger. The rates of HIT use decreased from 32.2\% in the age group 65 to 74 to 14.5\% in the age group 75 to 84 and 4.9\% in the 85 and older age group. For both genders, having seen or talked to a general practitioner increased the odds of HIT use. However, having seen or talked to a medical specialist, eye doctor, or physical therapist/occupational therapist (PT/OT) were significantly associated with HIT use only for older women, while having seen or talked to a mental health professional only marginally increased the odds of HIT use only for older men. Having visited or talked to a chiropractor and having had overnight hospitalization, surgery, and/or homecare services were not associated with the odds of HIT use for either gender. Conclusions: Older-adult users of general health services were more likely to use HIT than nonusers of general health services, while older-adult users of specialized health services were not different from nonusers of specialized health services in their odds of HIT use. The findings have implications for narrowing the age-related and socioeconomic status-related gaps in HIT use. The access gaps among racial/ethnic minority older adults and poorly educated and/or low-income older adults are especially striking and call for concerted efforts to facilitate Internet access and HIT use among these disadvantaged older adults.

Objective: We sought to understand caregivers\&\#8217; use of, interest in, and perceived barriers to health information technology for out-of-home caregiving. Methods: We conducted 2 sequential Web-based surveys with a national sample of individuals who provide out-of-home caregiving to an adult family member or friend with a chronic illness. We queried respondents about their use of health information technology for out-of-home caregiving and used multivariable regression to investigate caregiver and care-recipient characteristics associated with caregivers\&\#8217; technology use for caregiving. Results: Among 316 out-of-home caregiver respondents, 34.5\% (109/316) reported using health information technology for caregiving activities. The likelihood of a caregiver using technology increased significantly with intensity of caregiving (as measured by number of out-of-home caregiving activities). Compared with very low intensity caregivers, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of technology use was 1.88 (95\% CI 1.01-3.50) for low intensity caregivers, 2.39 (95\% CI 1.11-5.15) for moderate intensity caregivers, and 3.70 (95\% CI 1.62-8.45) for high intensity caregivers. Over 70\% (149/207) of technology nonusers reported interest in using technology in the future to support caregiving. The most commonly cited barriers to technology use for caregiving were health system privacy rules that restrict access to care-recipients\&\#8217; health information and lack of familiarity with programs or websites that facilitate out-of-home caregiving. Conclusions: Health information technology use for out-of-home caregiving is common, especially among individuals who provide more intense caregiving. Health care systems can address the mismatch between caregivers\&\#8217; interest in and use of technology by modifying privacy policies that impede information exchange.

	abstract = {Background: Reaction time, coordination, and cognition performance typically diminish in older adults, which may lead to gait impairments, falls, and injuries. Regular strength\&\#8211;balance exercises are highly recommended to reduce this problem and to improve health, well-being, and independence in old age. However, many older people face a lack of motivation in addition to other strong barriers to exercise. We developed ActiveLifestyle, an information technology (IT)-based system for active and healthy aging aiming at improving balance and strength. ActiveLifestyle is a training app that runs on a tablet and assists, monitors, and motivates older people to follow personalized training plans autonomously at home. Objective: The objectives were to (1) investigate which IT-mediated motivation strategies increase adherence to physical exercise training plans in older people, (2) assess the impact of ActiveLifestyle on physical activity behavior change, and (3) demonstrate the effectiveness of the ActiveLifestyle training to improve gait speed. Methods: A total of 44 older adults followed personalized, 12-week strength and balance training plans. All participants performed the exercises autonomously at home. Questionnaires were used to assess the technological familiarity and stage of behavior change, as well as the effectiveness of the motivation instruments adopted by ActiveLifestyle. Adherence to the exercise plan was evaluated using performance data collected by the app and through information given by the participants during the study. Pretests and posttests were performed to evaluate gait speed of the participants before and after the study. Results: Participants were 75 years (SD 6), predominantly female (64\%), held a trade or professional diploma (54\%), and their past profession was in a sitting position (43\%). Of the 44 participants who enrolled, 33 (75\%) completed the study. The app proved to assist and motivate independently living and healthy older adults to autonomously perform strength\&\#8211;balance exercises (median 6 on a 7-point Likert scale). Social motivation strategies proved more effective than individual strategies to stimulate the participants to comply with the training plan, as well as to change their behavior permanently toward a more physically active lifestyle. The exercises were effective to improve preferred and fast gait speed. Conclusions: ActiveLifestyle assisted and motivated independently living and healthy older people to autonomously perform strength\&\#8211;balance exercises over 12 weeks and had low dropout rates. The social motivation strategies were more effective to stimulate the participants to comply with the training plan and remain on the intervention. The adoption of assistive technology devices for physical intervention tends to motivate and retain older people exercising for longer periods of time.  [J Med Internet Res 2013;15(8):e159]},

	abstract = {Background: Falls and fall-related injuries pose a major threat to older peoples\&\#8217; health, and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. In the course of demographic changes, development and implementation of fall prevention strategies have been recognized as an urgent public health challenge. Various risk factors for falls and a number of effective interventions have been recognized. A substantial proportion of falls occur for people who are neither frail nor at high risk. Therefore, population-based approaches reaching the entire older population are needed. Objective: The objective of the study presented is the development, implementation, and evaluation of a population-based intervention for the prevention of falls and fall-related injuries in a medium sized city in Germany. Methods: The study is designed as a population-based approach. The intervention community is a mid sized city named Reutlingen in southern Germany with a population of 112,700 people. All community dwelling inhabitants 65 years and older are addressed. There are two main measures that are defined: (1) increase of overall physical activity, and (2) reduction of modifiable risk factors for falls such as deficits in strength and balance, home and environmental hazards, impaired vision, unsafe footwear, and improper use of assistive devices. The implementation strategies are developed in a participatory community planning process. These might include, for example, training of professionals and volunteers, improved availability of exercise classes, and education and raising awareness via newspaper, radio, or lectures. Results: The study starts in September 2010 and ends in December 2013. It is evaluated primarily by process evaluation as well as by telephone survey. Conclusions: Physical activity as a key message entails multiple positive effects with benefits on a range of geriatric symptoms. The strength of the design is the development of implementation strategies in a participatory community planning. The problems that we anticipate are the dependency on the stakeholders\&\#8217; willingness to participate, and the difficulty of evaluating population-based programs by hard end points.

According to the literature, there is an urgent need for coordination of care. Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of an online health community (OHC) intervention for older people with frailty aimed at facilitating multidisciplinary communication. Methods: The design was a controlled before-after study with 12 months follow-up in 11 family practices in the eastern part of the Netherlands. Participants consisted of frail older people living in the community requiring multidisciplinary (long-term) care. The intervention used was the health and welfare portal (ZWIP): an OHC for frail elderly patients, their informal caregivers and professionals.

Primary outcomes were scores on the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale (IADL), mental health, and social activity limitations. Results: There were 290 patients in the intervention group and 392 in the control group. Of these, 76/290 (26.2\%) in the intervention group actively used ZWIP.

	abstract = {Background
Computer-based interventions have demonstrated consistent positive effects on various physical abilities in older adults. This study aims to compare two training groups that achieve similar amounts of strength and balance exercise where one group receives an intervention that includes additional dance video gaming. The aim is to investigate the different effects of the training programs on physical and psychological parameters in older adults.

Methods
Thirty-one participants (mean age ± SD: 86.2 ± 4.6 years), residents of two Swiss hostels for the aged, were randomly assigned to either the dance group (n = 15) or the control group (n = 16). The dance group absolved a twelve-week cognitive-motor exercise program twice weekly that comprised progressive strength and balance training supplemented with additional dance video gaming. The control group performed only the strength and balance exercises during this period. Outcome measures were foot placement accuracy, gait performance under single and dual task conditions, and falls efficacy.

Results
After the intervention between-group comparison revealed significant differences for gait velocity (U = 26, P = .041, r = .45) and for single support time (U = 24, P = .029, r = .48) during the fast walking dual task condition in favor of the dance group. No significant between-group differences were observed either in the foot placement accuracy test or in falls efficacy.

Conclusions
There was a significant interaction in favor of the dance video game group for improvements in step time. Significant improved fast walking performance under dual task conditions (velocity, double support time, step length) was observed for the dance video game group only. These findings suggest that in older adults a cognitive-motor intervention may result in more improved gait under dual task conditions in comparison to a traditional strength and balance exercise program.

	abstract = {Background: Digital media and gaming have received considerable interest from researchers and clinicians as a model for learning a broad range of complex tasks and facilitating the transfer of skills to daily life. These emerging rehabilitation technologies have the potential to improve clinical outcomes and patient participation because they are engaging, motivating, and accessible. Our research goal is to develop preventative and therapeutic point-of-care eHealth applications that will lead to equivalent or better long-term health outcomes and health care costs than existing programs. We have produced a novel computer-aided tele-rehabilitation platform that combines computer game-based exercises with tele-monitoring. Objective: Compare the therapeutic effectiveness of an in-home, game-based rehabilitation program (GRP) to standard care delivered in an outpatient physical therapy clinic on measures of balance, gaze control, dizziness, and health-related quality of life. Methods: A randomized, controlled, single-blind pilot trial will be conducted. Fifty-six participants with a diagnosis of peripheral vestibular disorder will be randomly assigned to either usual physical therapy (comparator group) or to a game-based intervention (experimental group). Measures to be assessed will include gaze control, dynamic balance, and self-reported measures of dizziness. Results: The project was funded and enrollment was started in August 2014. To date, 36 participants have been enrolled. There have been 6 drop-outs. It is expected that the study will be completed January 2016 and the first results are expected to be submitted for publication in Spring of 2016. Conclusions: A successful application of this rehabilitation program would help streamline rehabilitation services, leverage therapist time spent with clients, and permit regular practice times at the client\&\#8217;s convenience.

	abstract = {Background: Home-based exercise programs can improve physical functioning and health status of elderly people. Successful implementation of exercise interventions for older people presents major challenges and supporting elderly people properly while doing their home-based exercises is essential for training success. We developed a tablet-based system\&\#8212;ActiveLifestyle\&\#8212;that offers older adults a home-based strength-balance training program with incorporated motivation strategies and support features. Objective: The goal was to compare 3 different home-based training programs with respect to their effect on measures of gait quality and physical performance through planned comparisons between (1) tablet-based and brochure-based interventions, (2) individual and social motivation strategies, and (3) active and inactive participants. Methods: A total of 44 autonomous-living elderly people (mean 75, SD 6 years) were assigned to 3 training groups: social (tablet guided, n=14), individual (tablet guided, n=13), and brochure (brochure guided, n=17). All groups joined a 12-week progressive home-based strength-balance training program. Outcome measures were gait performance under single and dual task conditions, dual task costs of walking, falls efficacy, and physical performance as measured by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Furthermore, active (\&\#8805;75\% program compliance) and inactive (\&\#60;75\% program compliance) individuals were compared based on their characteristics and outcome measures. Results: The tablet groups showed significant improvements in single and dual task walking, whereas there were no significant changes observable in the brochure group. Between-groups comparisons revealed significant differences for gait velocity ( U= 138.5;  P =.03,  r= .33) and cadence ( U= 138.5,  P =.03  r= .34) during dual task walking at preferred speed in favor of the tablet groups. The brochure group had more inactive participants, but this did not reach statistical significance ( U= 167,  P =.06,  r= .29). The active participants outperformed the inactive participants in single and dual task walking, dual task costs of walking, and SPPB scores. Significant between-groups differences were seen between the tablet groups and the brochure group, in favor of the tablet groups. Conclusions: A tablet-based strength-balance training program that allows monitoring and assisting autonomous-living older adults while training at home was more effective in improving gait and physical performance when compared to a brochure-based program. Social or individual motivation strategies were equally effective. The most prominent differences were observed between active and inactive participants. These findings suggest that in older adults a tablet-based intervention enhances training compliance; hence, it is an effective way to improve gait.  [J Med Internet Res 2014;16(6):e159]},

	abstract = {Background: An increasing amount of health care is now performed in a home setting, away from the hospital. While there is growing anecdotal evidence about the difficulty patients and caregivers have using increasingly complex health care devices in the home, there has been little systematic scientific study to quantify the global nature of home health care device usability in the field. Research has tended to focus on a handful of devices, making it difficult to gain a broad view of the usability of home-care devices in general. Objective: The objective of this paper is to describe a remote usability assessment method using the System Usability Scale (SUS), and to report on the usability of a broad range of health care devices using this metric. Methods: A total of 271 participants selected and rated up to 10 home health care devices of their choice using the SUS, which scores usability from 0 (unusable) to 100 (highly usable). Participants rated a total of 455 devices in their own home without an experimenter present. Results: Usability scores ranged from 98 (oxygen masks) to 59 (home hormone test kits). An analysis conducted on devices that had at least 10 ratings showed that the effect of device on SUS scores was significant ( P \&\#60;.001), and that the usability of these devices was on the low end when compared with other commonly used items in the home, such as microwave ovens and telephones. Conclusions: A large database of usability scores for home health care devices collected using this remote methodology would be beneficial for physicians, patients, and their caregivers.

	abstract = {Establishing guidelines for culturally competent medical care will help all physicians to fulfill their mandate to meet the health care needs of the individual patient as well as of patient populations, and to lower costs by encouraging a healing partnership with the patient, thus increasing patient responsibility for his or her own health. Being culturally sensitive is not enough. Nor is simply classifying patients according to race adequate. Many researchers in social science and health services increasingly agree that race in our heterogeneous U.S. population has limited biological meaning and more often than not is just a poor proxy for culture or socioeconomic status. Guidelines and quality indicators that seek to measure and improve cultural competence must take into account, in an integrated fashion, these three necessary components in the delivery of high-quality services to populations: 1) the health-related cultural factors; 2) the incidence and prevalence of diseases in the population; and 3) treatment outcomes peculiar to that population. To be culturally competent is to incorporate and integrate these critical factors into caring for diverse populations. If health care systems, individually and collectively, are to provide care of high quality that is cost-effective to all populations, researchers and funders of research must invest in an aggressive agenda that pursues two directions: the validation of existing quality indicators in minority populations, and the development of new quality indicators that assess the organization's ability to develop culturally competent care. Only in this way will those of us in the medical profession be able to fulfill our calling to relieve suffering without discriminating against some populations.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: While recognized that global actors influence health information system design, studies of health informatics have largely focused on micro politics of technology design and implementation. Here a problematic patient care information system (PCIS) is discussed in relation to federal and provincial policies and corporate strategies to demonstrate that our understanding of health informatics can be enhanced by linking micro studies of health informatics to larger macro contexts.
METHODS: Interviews and document study.
RESULTS: Although the extent to which federal initiatives influenced (or failed to influence) provincial and hospital initiatives remains debateable, events initiated at one level (the hospital's decision to implement software, initiated at the organizational level) are influenced (perhaps indirectly) by developments in other contexts (federal/macro changes gave an initiative more weight; provincial initiatives such as the Labour Accord altered the industrial relations environment in which system development occurred).
CONCLUSIONS: Micro-studies of work practice, invaluable in addressing interactions between technologies, users and work practices, often fail to account for the historic reach of global actors, although it is often these historic circumstances that contribute to present-day interactions between user, information system and organization, and that find expression - often indirectly - in daily work practices.},

This paper extends our knowledge of these issues for large complex distributed organisations. It is based on an analysis of the failure of a large IT system selected by a major state public health service for Statewide implementation. The system selected was well proven overseas, was implemented through a pilot process, yet was withdrawn because it did not meet requirements. The issues which are dealt with include the nature of the organisation and its interaction with the implementation strategy, the nature of decision-making, the contrast between the incentives and perspectives at different levels, ownership of the program, management of skills and the impact of instability and complexity. The option of decentralised IT management is raised and the advantages of common systems discussed. A proposal is ventured for managing such developments while maintaining essential commonality. The paper demonstrates that the environment of large complex distributed organisations introduces a complex of issues that are not normally considered in implementation strategy.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To identify success and failure factors in the design process of a regional health information system.
METHODS: A constructive evaluation study including interviews, observations, usability study and document analysis.
RESULTS: Modelling was found to be a key element for the successful implementation of a health information system. The developed service chain model helped to define use cases and to implement seamless service chains. User participation in the design process was a success factor resulting in good user acceptance and signs of positive impacts on work practices. Evaluation study also helped system developers to guide the system's further development. An important failure factor identified was the lack of semantic interoperability of the system components.
CONCLUSIONS: The results emphasize the socio-technical nature of health information systems. The starting point for development should be thorough insight into the health care work practices where the information systems are to be used. Successful system design should start from modelling of work processes, data and information flows and definition of concepts and their relations.

	abstract = {Background: Health care is entering the Information Society. It is evident that the use of modern information and communication technology offers tremendous opportunities to improve health care. However, there are also hazards associated with information technology in health care. Evaluation is a means to assess the quality, value, effects and impacts of information technology and applications in the health care environment, to improve health information applications and to enable the emergence of an evidence-based health informatics profession and practice. Objective: In order to identify and address the frequent problems of getting evaluation understood and recognised, to promote transdisciplinary exchange within evaluation research, and to promote European cooperation, the Exploratory Workshop on “New Approaches to the Systematic Evaluation of Health Information Systems” (HIS-EVAL) was organized by the University for Health Sciences, Medical Informatics and Technology (UMIT), Innsbruck, Austria, in April 2003 with sponsorship from the European Science Foundation (ESF). Methods: The overall program was structured in three main parts: (a) discussion of problems and barriers to evaluation; (b) defining our visions and strategies with regard to evaluation of health information systems; and (c) organizing short-term and long-term activities to reach those visions and strategies. Results: The workshop participants agreed on the Declaration of Innsbruck (see Appendix B), comprising four observations and 12 recommendations with regard to evaluation of health information systems. Future activities comprise European networking as well as the development of guidelines and standards for evaluation studies. Conclusion: The HIS-EVAL workshop was intended to be the starting point for setting up a network of European scientists working on evaluation of health information systems, to obtain synergy effects by combining the research traditions from different evaluation fields, leading to a new dimension and collaboration on further research on information systems’ evaluation.},

Despite best practice research that identified success factors for health information technology projects, a majority, in some sense, still fail. Similar problems plague a variety of different kinds of applications, and have done so for many years. Ten AMIA working groups sponsored a workshop at the AMIA Fall 2006 Symposium. It was entitled “Avoiding The F-Word: IT Project Morbidity, Mortality, and Immortality” and focused on this under-addressed problem. Participants discussed communication, workflow, and quality; the complexity of information technology undertakings; the need to integrate all aspects of projects, work environments, and regulatory and policy requirements; and the difficulty of getting all the parts and participants in harmony. While recognizing that there still are technical issues related to functionality and interoperability, discussion affirmed the emerging consensus that problems are due to sociological, cultural, and financial issues, and hence are more managerial than technical. Participants drew on lessons from experience and research in identifying important issues, action items, and recommendations to address the following: what “success” and “failure” mean, what contributes to making successful or unsuccessful systems, how to use failure as an enhanced learning opportunity for continued improvement, how system successes or failures should be studied, and what AMIA should do to enhance opportunities for successes. The workshop laid out a research agenda and recommended action items, reflecting the conviction that AMIA members and AMIA as an organization can take a leadership role to make projects more practical and likely to succeed in health care settings.},

Methods: Based on own experience and backed up by a literature review, some important problems during IT evaluation in health care together with their reasons, consequences and possible solutions are presented and structured. Results and conclusions: We define three main problem areas—the complexity of the evaluation object, the complexity of an evaluation project, and the motivation for evaluation. Many evaluation problems can be subsumed under those three problem areas. A broadly accepted framework for evaluation of IT in healthcare seems desirable to address those problems. Such a framework should help to formulate relevant questions, to find adequate methods and tools, and to apply them in a sensible way.},

	abstract = {SummaryBackground and purpose
The generalised assumption of health information systems (HIS) success is questioned by a few commentators in the medical informatics field. They point to widespread HIS failure. The purpose of this paper was therefore to develop a better conceptual foundation for, and practical guidance on, health information systems failure (and success).
Methods
Literature and case analysis plus pilot testing of developed model.
Results
Defining HIS failure and success is complex, and the current evidence base on HIS success and failure rates was found to be weak. Nonetheless, the best current estimate is that HIS failure is an important problem. The paper therefore derives and explains the “design–reality gap” conceptual model. This is shown to be robust in explaining multiple cases of HIS success and failure, yet provides a contingency that encompasses the differences which exist in different HIS contexts. The design–reality gap model is piloted to demonstrate its value as a tool for risk assessment and mitigation on HIS projects. It also throws into question traditional, structured development methodologies, highlighting the importance of emergent change and improvisation in HIS.
Conclusions
The design–reality gap model can be used to address the problem of HIS failure, both as a post hoc evaluative tool and as a pre hoc risk assessment and mitigation tool. It also validates a set of methods, techniques, roles and competencies needed to support the dynamic improvisations that are found to underpin cases of HIS success.},

	abstract = {Background: Information technology (IT) plays a key role in public health care management because it could improve quality, efficiency, and patient care. Researchers and practitioners repeatedly contend that a health care organization’s information systems strategy should be aligned with its objectives and strategies, a notion commonly known as IT alignment.
Purpose: Actor-related IT alignment issues in health care institutions were explored in this study. More specifically, it explores the possibility of moving beyond the current IT alignment perspective and, in so doing, explores whether IT alignment—as currently conceptualized in the dominant body of research—is sufficient for attaining improved quality, efficiency, and patient care in health care organizations.
Methods: The findings are based on a qualitative and longitudinal study of six health care organizations in the Stockholm metropolitan area. The empirical data were gathered over the 2005–2011 period from interviews, a focus group, observations, and archival material.
Findings: The data suggest recurrent misalignments between IT strategy and organizational strategy and operations due to the failure to deconstruct the IT artifact and to the existence of various levels of IT maturity.
Conclusions: A more complex picture of IT alignment in health care that goes beyond the current perspective is being offered by this study. It argues that the previously common way of handling IT as a single artifact and applying one IT strategy to the entire organizational system is obsolete.
Managerial Implications: The article suggests that considerable benefits can be gained by assessing IT maturity and its impact on IT alignment. The article also shows that there are different kinds of IT in medical care that requires diverse decisions, investments, prioritizations, and implementation approaches.},

Dependent variables included risk-adjusted patient self-care quality measures. Results: Areas with high levels of NA/AN residents had poorer quality outcomes across both utilization (e.g., hospital admission) and improvement measures (e.g., walking, bathing), for 9 of 12 risk-adjusted patient self-care quality measures. Discussion: Identifying gaps in quality among multiple measures of home health care for high-risk areas allows practitioners and home health care service providers to target quality improvement interventions.},

Methods: Qualitative research was conducted by following the Framework method. Rich contextual data were obtained through focus group meetings participated by domain experts. The analysis results were further refined in an online forum and validated at a final meeting.
Results: Four focus groups involving a total of 20 participants resulted in useful discussions during which various perspectives were expressed by the expert participants. A well-defined set of 17 KPIDs emerged under four categories, namely, economical value, sociocultural sensitivity, interpersonal relationships, and clinical capabilities.
Conclusions: The feedback we received from the focus groups indicates that performance improvement in HHAs is a lot more complicated than simply assessing whether certain clinical tasks are performed. The KPIDs identified in this study can help HHAs in their focused and individualized QAPI initiatives. Therefore, the results should be immediately relevant, interesting, and useful to the home care industry and policy makers in the US.},

	abstract = {Background. Despite the plethora of information concerning risk factors for falls, limited research efforts have focused on the issue of the differences in risk factors for falls based on fall status, or more specifically one-time versus chronic/recurrent fallers. Given that multiple falls have been found to be associated with negative outcomes, such as an increased risk of institutionalization, more research in this area is warranted.
Methods. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the risk factors for nonfallers versus fallers (1+ falls), and for nonfallers/one-time fallers versus recurrent fallers (2+ falls). All participants (N = 2304) in this study were receiving home care services from 10 community-based agencies (Community Care Access Centres) in Ontario, Canada. The Minimum Data Set–Home Care (MDS-HC) is an assessment instrument that covers several key domains, such as service use, function, health, and social support. Nurses trained to administer the MDS-HC assessed each of the participants within their homes.
Results. Of the 2304 participants in the study, 27\% fell one or more times, and 10\% experienced multiple falls (2+ falls). In the two final logistic regression models for risk of falling (0 falls vs 1+ falls) and multiple falling (0 falls/1 fall vs 2+ falls), the independent variables that remained significant included gender, gait, environmental hazards, and the Changes in Health, End Stage Disease and Signs and Symptoms of Medical Problems Scale. Also significant in the model for multiple falls was the Cognitive Performance Scale, Parkinson's disease, and perceived health status.
Conclusions. Overall, distinguishing individuals into different fall status classifications is important from a clinical perspective, as it is the recurrent faller who would benefit to the greatest extent from fall prevention efforts and from the negative outcomes associated with multiple falls (i.e., mortality). One of the most significant barriers in determining risk factors for falls is the lack of consistency in the variables/tools used in the research. As such, utilizing a standardized tool, such as the MDS-HC, would assist researchers in making comparisons between different settings.},

Elderly falls are associated with long hospital stays, major morbidity, and mortality. We sought to examine the fate of patients ≥75 years of age admitted after falls.
Methods
We reviewed all fall admissions in 2008. Causes, comorbidities, injuries, procedures, mortality, readmission, and costs were analyzed.
Results
Seven hundred eight patients ≥75 years old were admitted after a fall, with 89\% being simple falls. Short-term mortality was 6\%. Male sex, atrial fibrillation, acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure (CHF), intracranial hemorrhage, hospital-acquired pneumonia, trigger events, Clostridium difficile, and intubation were predictors of death (P \&lt; .05). Thirty-day readmission occurred in 14\%; CHF, craniotomy, and acute renal failure were predictive. The median cost of hospitalization was \$11,000 with cardiac disease, anemia, major orthopedic and neurosurgical procedures, pneumonia, and intubation as predictive.
Conclusions
Simple falls in the elderly have high morbidity, mortality, and costs. Methodologies for prevention are warranted and should be studied intensively.},

	abstract = {Background and objectives
Contactless monitoring is increasingly used to enhance qualitative and cost-effective care for older persons. Succesful integration of this technology in older peoples’ daily lives, depends on their acceptance of these systems. The primary purpose was to explore attitudes and perceptions of adults of 60 years and older towards contactless monitoring of the activities of daily living.
Design, participants and methods
A questionnaire was developed, validated and used in a cross-sectional survey with a convenience sample (n = 245). The results were presented using descriptive statistics and bivariate analyses to explore variables associated with willingness to install the technology.
Results
Descriptive statistics indicate that adults of 60 years and older find contactless monitoring useful for various purposes (e.g. to remain living at home longer, safely and independently; for timely detection of emergency situations and gradually emerging health problems). They agree to share collected information with professional caregivers and own access to the data is valued. Respondents like to take part in diverse decisions about the monitoring (e.g. about the rooms in which it is installed, the type of sensors used and access of third parties to collected information). However, several concerns were expressed related to the functioning and financing of contactless monitoring. Bivariate analyses show that both socio-demographic factors (e.g. age, receiving professional home care) and attitudes and perceptions towards contactless monitoring (e.g. on its potential usefulness, on the availability of collected information, on the functional requirements and financial costs of the system and on the use of video cameras) can promote or impede acceptance of the technology.
Conclusions
This explorative study indicates that older adults are willing to incorporate contactless monitoring in later life or when their health declines. They agree to share collected information with professional caregivers and clearly demand for participation in decisions about the technology. Various concerns and requirements provide implications for clinical practice and future research. Thereby, technology developpers, policy makers and professional caregivers can promote the implementation of contactless monitoring in the care for older adults.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the safety and feasibility of using Nintendo Wii Fit exergames to improve balance in older adults.
METHODS: Seven older adults aged 84 (5) years with impaired balance (Berg Balance Scale [BBS] score {\textless} 52 points) were recruited from 4 continuing care retirement communities to participate in a single group pre- and postevaluation of Wii Fit exergames. Participants received individualized instructions (at least 5 home visits) on playing 4 exergames (basic step, soccer heading, ski slalom, and table tilt) and were asked to play these games in their homes at least 30 minutes 3 times per week for 3 months and received weekly telephone follow-up. They also completed a paper log of their exergame play and rated their enjoyment immediately after each session. Participants completed the BBS, 4-Meter Timed Walk test, and the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale at baseline and 3 months. Semistructured interviews were conducted at the 3-month evaluation.
RESULTS: Participants safely and independently played a mean of 50 sessions, median session duration of 31 minutes. Two of the games were modified to ensure participants' safety. Participants rated high enjoyment immediately after exergame play and expressed experiencing improved balance with daily activities and desire to play exergames with their grandchildren. Berg Balance Scores increased from 49 (2.1) to 53 (1.8) points (P = .017). Walking speed increased from 1.04 (0.2) to 1.33 (0.84) m/s (P = .018).
CONCLUSIONS: Use of Wii Fit for limited supervised balance training in the home was safe and feasible for a selected sample of older adults. Further research is needed to determine clinical efficacy in a larger, diverse sample and ascertain whether Wii Fit exergames can be integrated into physical therapy practice to promote health in older adults.},

Yet a major influence on the safety, quality, and effectiveness of home health care will be the set of issues encompassed by the field of human factors research–the discipline of applying what is known about human capabilities and limitations to the design of products, processes, systems, and work environments. To address these challenges, the National Research Council began a multidisciplinary study to examine a diverse range of behavioral and human factors issues resulting from the increasing migration of medical devices, technologies, and care practices into the home. Its goal is to lay the groundwork for a thorough integration of human factors research with the design and implementation of home health care devices, technologies, and practices. On October 1 and 2, 2009, a group of human factors and other experts met to consider a diverse range of behavioral and human factors issues associated with the increasing migration of medical devices, technologies, and care practices into the home. This book is a summary of that workshop, representing the culmination of the first phase of the study.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Home healthcare robots promise to make clinical information available at the right place and time, thereby reducing error and increasing safety and quality. However, it has been frequently reported that more than 40\% of previous information technology (IT) developments have failed or been abandoned due to the lack of understanding of the sociotechnical aspects of IT.
OBJECTIVE: Previous home healthcare robots research has focused on technology development and clinical applications. There has been little discussion of associated social, technical and managerial issues that are arguably of equal importance for robot success. To fill this knowledge gap, this research aims to understand the determinants of home healthcare robots adoption from these aspects by applying technology acceptance theories.
METHODS: We employed both qualitative and quantitative methods. The participants were recruited from home healthcare agencies located in the U.S. (n=108), which included both patients and healthcare professionals. We collected data via a survey study to test a research model.
RESULTS: The usage intention of home healthcare robots is a function of social influence, performance expectancy, trust, privacy concerns, ethical concerns and facilitating conditions. Among them, social influence is the strongest predictor. Monitoring vital signs and facilitating communication with family and medication reminders are the most preferable tasks and applications for robots.
CONCLUSION: Sociotechnical factors play a powerful role in explaining the adoption intention for home healthcare robots. The findings provide insights on how home healthcare service providers and robot designers may improve the success of robot technologies.},

Examining the views of these stakeholders on SAR is fundamental in order to conceive acceptable and useful SAR for dementia care. This study investigated SAR acceptance among three groups of older adults living in the community: persons with Mild Cognitive Impairment, informal caregivers of persons with dementia, and healthy older adults. Different technology acceptance questions related to the robot and user characteristics, potential applications, feelings about technology, ethical issues, and barriers and facilitators for SAR adoption, were addressed in a mixed-method study. Participants (n = 25) completed a survey and took part in a focus group (n = 7). A functional robot prototype, a multimedia presentation, and some use-case scenarios provided a base for the discussion. Content analysis was carried out based on recorded material from focus groups. Results indicated that an accurate insight of influential factors for SAR acceptance could be gained by combining quantitative and qualitative methods. Participants acknowledged the potential benefits of SAR for supporting care at home for individuals with cognitive impairment. In all the three groups, intention to use SAR was found to be lower for the present time than that anticipated for the future. However, caregivers and persons with MCI had a higher perceived usefulness and intention to use SAR, at the present time, than healthy older adults, confirming that current needs are strongly related to technology acceptance and should influence SAR design. A key theme that emerged in this study was the importance of customizing SAR appearance, services, and social capabilities. Mismatch between needs and solutions offered by the robot, usability factors, and lack of experience with technology, were seen as the most important barriers for SAR adoption.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Frailty is a geriatric syndrome resulting from age-related cumulative decline across multiple physiologic systems, impaired homeostatic reserve, and reduced capacity to resist stress. Based on recent estimates, 10\% of community-dwelling older individuals are frail and another 41.6\% are prefrail. Frail elders account for the highest health care costs in industrialized nations. Impaired physical function is a major indicator of frailty, and functional performance tests are useful for the identification of frailty. Objective instrumented assessments of physical functioning that are feasible for home frailty screening have not been adequately developed.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the ability of wearable sensor-based in-home assessment of gait, balance, and physical activity (PA) to discriminate between frailty levels (nonfrail, prefrail, and frail).
METHODS: In an observational cross-sectional study, in-home visits were completed in 125 older adults (nonfrail: n=44, prefrail: n=60, frail: n=21) living in Tucson, Ariz., USA, between September 2012 and November 2013. Temporal-spatial gait parameters (speed, stride length, stride time, double support, and variability of stride velocity), postural balance (sway of hip, ankle, and center of mass), and PA (percentage of walking, standing, sitting, and lying; mean duration and variability of single walking, standing, sitting, and lying bouts) were measured in the participant's home using validated wearable sensor technology. Logistic regression was used to assess the most sensitive gait, balance, and PA variables for identifying prefrail participants (vs. nonfrail). Multinomial logistic regression was used to identify variables sensitive to discriminate between three frailty levels.
RESULTS: Gait speed (area under the curve, AUC=0.802), hip sway (AUC=0.734), and steps/day (AUC=0.736) were the most sensitive parameters for the identification of prefrailty. Multinomial regression revealed that stride length (AUC=0.857) and double support (AUC=0.841) were the most sensitive gait parameters for discriminating between three frailty levels. Interestingly, walking bout duration variability was the most sensitive PA parameter for discriminating between three frailty levels (AUC=0.818). No balance parameter discriminated between three frailty levels.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that unique parameters derived from objective assessment of gait, balance, and PA are sensitive for the identification of prefrailty and the classification of a subject's frailty level. The present findings highlight the potential of wearable sensor technology for in-home assessment of frailty status.},

	abstract = {With the upcoming reform of the healthcare system and the greater emphasis on care in the home and other living environments, geriatric providers will need alternate ways of monitoring disease, activity, response to therapy, and patient safety. Current understanding of the dynamic nature of chronic illnesses, their effects on health over time, and the ability to manage them in the community are limited to measuring a set of variables at discrete points in time, which does not account for the dynamic interactions between physiological systems and the environments of daily life. Recent developments of sensors, data recorders, and communication networks allow the unprecedented measurements of physiological and sociological data for use in geriatrics care. This article identifies and discusses the important issues regarding the use of monitoring technologies in elderly patients. The goals are fourfold. First, some emerging technology that may improve the lives of older adults and improve care are highlighted. Second, the possible applications of technology in geriatrics settings are discussed, with a focus on acute falls, dementia, and cardiac conditions. Third, real and perceived concerns in using monitoring technology are identified and addressed, including technology adoption by elderly people; stigma; and the reduction in social contact; ethical concerns of privacy, autonomy, and consent; concerns of clinicians, including information overload, licensure, and liability; current reimbursement schemes for using technology; and the reliability and infrastructure needed for monitoring technology. Fourth, future approaches to make monitoring technology useful and available in geriatrics are recommended.},

This article presents features of smartphone interventions for long-term chronic condition management, illustrating how these applications benefit patients with chronic diseases. Materials and Methods: Systematic searches for smartphone health interventions were conducted in five publication databases. Articles were included only if (1) the smartphone application (app) was exclusively developed for patients with chronic diseases and (2) the article incorporated a defined outcome measurement to evaluate the effects of the implemented intervention. Sixteen articles were included in the final review, including studies in diabetes, mental health problems, overweight, cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Results: These studies found that the smartphone intervention was a completely or at least partially effective tool to assist in managing some chronic diseases. With the help of health-related smartphone apps, patients with chronic conditions (1) felt secure in the knowledge that their illnesses were closely monitored, (2) participated in their own health management more effectively, and (3) felt that they had not been forgotten by their doctors and were taken good care of even outside the hospital/clinic. Conclusions: However, there are limited smartphone apps for the long-term health management of chronic diseases. More smartphone apps need to be developed to help people manage chronic diseases.},

	abstract = {Background and purpose
Patient falls are the leading cause of unintentional injury and death among older adults. In 2000, falls resulted in over 10,300 elderly deaths, costing the United States approximately \$179 million in incidence and medical costs. Furthermore, non-fatal injuries caused by falls cost the United States \$19 billion annually. Health information technology (IT) applications, specifically electronic falls reporting systems, can aid quality improvement efforts to prevent patient falls. Yet, long-term residential care facilities (LTRCFs) often do not have the financial resources to implement health IT, and workers in these settings are often not ready to adopt such systems. Additionally, most health IT evaluations are conducted in large acute-care settings, so LTRCF administrators currently lack evidence to support the value of health IT.
Methods
In this paper, we detail the development of a novel, easy-to-use system to facilitate electronic patient falls reporting within a LTRCF using off-the-shelf technology that can be inexpensively implemented in a wide variety of settings. We report the results of four complimentary system evaluation measures that take into consideration varied organizational stakeholders’ perspectives: (1) System-level benefits and costs, (2) system usability, via scenario-based use cases, (3) a holistic assessment of users’ physical, cognitive, and marcoergonomic (work system) challenges in using the system, and (4) user technology acceptance. We report the viability of collecting and analyzing data specific to each evaluation measure and detail the relative merits of each measure in judging whether the system is acceptable to each stakeholder.
Results and conclusions
The electronic falls reporting system was successfully implemented, with 100\% reporting at 3-months post-implementation. The system-level benefits and costs approach showed that the electronic system required no initial investment costs aside from personnel costs and significant benefits accrued from user time savings. The usability analysis revealed several fixable design flaws and demonstrated the importance of scenario-based user training. The technology acceptance model showed that users perceived the reporting system to be useful and easy to use, even more so after implementation. Finally, the holistic human factors evaluation identified challenges encountered when nurses used the system as a part of their daily work, guiding further system redesign. The four-pronged evaluation framework accounted for varied stakeholder perspectives and goals and is a highly scalable framework that can be easily applied to health IT implementations in other LTRCFs.},

	abstract = {The pediatric obesity has become a real problem for the public health. One estimates that about 16\% of the Belgian pediatric population and up to 33\% of the Americans are concerned by this problematic. 70\% of the teenagers will remain obese once adult if no treatment is proposed during the childhood. Because of that evolution, some journalists wrote: "that the old continent would be able to  catch up with the new world in the next ten years". The malnutrition is not however the only factor at the origin of the obesity. The sedentary lifestyle (lack of exercise, TV, Internet, video games) the domestic organization, the "various emotional stress "are to be blamed. It is without taking into consideration the paradox of our consumption society that while extolling the cult of the slim, young and dynamic body, etc., pushes us to consume more, encouraging in some social and cultural surroundings to go for the immediate pleasure to the detriment of the knowledge - understanding - of our own body. Which places the obese child in an existential paradox. If on top of it there is  a domestic predisposition to the plumpness, the kilograms in excess are threatening the unsecured child and new sufferings stand out on the horizon : relational unrests, isolation, social dismissal, reduction of the esteem of selfesteem as well as lack of confidence, less freedom, depression, etc. Not only are they victims of mockeries, aggressiveness and exclusion, the children put their health in danger. On those children we can notice an increase of the impact of cardiovascular pathologies, diabetes, cancers of the intestines, etc. In "Clairs Vallons" we put the hypothesis that the children and the teenagers who come here in custody could suffer from a lack of presence as well as people listening to them and that therefore to would search for comfort in eating. We consider that all interventions based solely on the interdiction of the symptom have no result, causes more suffering and a displacement of the symptom. The therapeutic work to the Dietary Residency of "Clairs Vallons" consists therefore  in a global approach of the child within a multidisciplinary team (pediatrician,  dietitian, psychologist, physiotherapist, social assistant, orthofenist, educator and teacher) all united around the concept "to eat happy".},

DESIGN: Two groups, nonrandomized; 3 outcome assessments: at baseline, immediately after the game (post 1), and 8-10 weeks after the game (post 2). PARTICIPANTS: A total of 179 Chinese children aged 8-12 years. INTERVENTION: The treatment group played Diab; the control group received no intervention. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Motivation; self-efficacy; preference for fruit, vegetables, water, and PA; as well as PA behavior. ANALYSIS: Adjusted changes to post 1 and post 2 by ANCOVA controlling for demographic and baseline variables. RESULTS: Children who played Diab had increased intrinsic motivation for fruit and water, self-efficacy for PA, and self-reported PA scores at post 1  (all P {\textless} .05). Children with higher immersion scores (above the median) had increased intrinsic motivation for fruit and water, and autonomous and controlled motivation for PA at post 1 (all P {\textless} .05). However, these were not significant at post 2. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Diab provides a promising innovative medium for promoting Chinese children's psychological correlates of diet and PA and PA behavior.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Regular physical activity (PA) in young needs to be promoted to prevent obesity and subsequent diabetes. Influences of parental PA on adolescents' activity level have been studied with discordant results and the effect of socioeconomic status (SES) on these relationships is not clarified. METHODS: Cross-sectional population-based survey of about 3000 12-year old French students and their parents. Familial associations were assessed with logistic regression models taking into account SES and children's and parents' corpulence. Sport involvement and sedentary behaviors were assessed by standardized questionnaires filled out separately by children and parents, the latter also reporting their educational data and family income tax. RESULTS: Participation in structured PA outside school was higher for boys (74\%) than for girls (58\%, p{\textless}10-5) and a high sedentary behavior (watching television, playing computer/video games and reading {\textgreater} or =2h/day) was observed in one-third of the sample, both in boys and in girls. Children were more likely to participate in structured PA outside school when both parents practiced sport as compared to neither parent practicing it, with an odd ratio OR (95\%CI) of 1.97 (1.4-2.8) for  boys and 1.56 (1.2-2.1) for girls. Familial associations of inactivity were significant for boys only. A greater percentage of adolescents had a high level of sedentary behavior when both parents versus no parents watched television {\textgreater} 2h/day (OR 1.95 (1.52.6)). Parent-child physical activity relationships were not  modified by the family SES or the children's or parents' weight status. CONCLUSION: Parental involvement in sport is an important correlate of a young adolescent's participation in structured PA outside school, whatever the family SES or corpulence of the family members.},

A secondary objective was to examine the extent to which metabolic (body mass index, high-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol) and inflammatory (C-reactive protein) markers mediate the relationship between screen time and CVD events. BACKGROUND: Although some evidence suggests that prolonged sitting is linked to CVD risk factor development regardless of physical activity participation, studies with hard outcomes are scarce. METHODS: A population sample of 4,512 (1,945 men) Scottish Health Survey 2003 respondents ({\textgreater}/=35 years) were followed up to 2007 for all-cause mortality and CVD events (fatal and nonfatal combined). Main exposures were interviewer-assessed screen time ({\textless}2 h/day; 2 to {\textless}4 h/day; and {\textgreater}/=4 h/day) and moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity. RESULTS: Two hundred fifteen CVD events and 325 any-cause deaths occurred during 19,364 follow-up person-years. The covariable (age, sex, ethnicity, obesity, smoking, social class, long-standing illness, marital status, diabetes, hypertension)-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality was 1.52 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06 to 2.16) and for CVD events was 2.30 (95\% CI: 1.33 to 3.96) for participants engaging in {\textgreater}/=4 h/day of screen time relative to {\textless}2 h/day. Adjusting for physical activity attenuated these associations only slightly (all-cause mortality: HR: 1.48, 95\% CI: 1.04 to 2.13;  CVD events: HR: 2.25, 95\% CI: 1.30 to 3.89). Exclusion of participants with CVD events in the first 2 years of follow-up and previous cancer registrations did not change these results appreciably. Approximately 25\% of the association between screen time and CVD events was explained collectively by C-reactive protein, body mass index, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. CONCLUSIONS:  Recreational sitting, as reflected by television/screen viewing time, is related  to raised mortality and CVD risk regardless of physical activity participation. Inflammatory and metabolic risk factors partly explain this relationship.},

The body mass index of 6,740 children aged 7-18 years was compared with the Working Group on Obesity in China cut-off value to estimate the prevalence of obesity. A  case-control study of obese and non-obese children was carried out to study risk  factors for obesity. A standardized questionnaire was used to collect information on possible risk factors causing obesity. Univariate analysis was performed first to compare the distribution of risk factors between cases and controls. Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to assess independent risk factors of obesity. The results showed that the overall prevalence of obesity among school-aged children was 4.11\% (4.63\% for males and 3.57\% for females). A total of 516 subjects (258 pairs of cases and controls) were included in the final analysis. High maternal education and a longer sleeping time were shown to  be protective factors against obesity (odds ratio [OR] 0.148, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.074-0.296 and OR 0.472, 95\% CI 0.342-0.652, respectively).

Childhood obesity is a leading public health concern because  overweight-obese youth suffer from comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease, conditions once considered limited to adults. This increasing prevalence of chronic health conditions in youth closely parallels the dramatic increase in obesity, in particular abdominal adiposity, in youth. Although mounting evidence in adults demonstrates the benefits of regular physical activity as a treatment strategy for abdominal obesity, the independent  role of regular physical activity alone (e.g., without calorie restriction) on abdominal obesity, and in particular visceral fat, is largely unclear in youth. There is some evidence to suggest that, independent of sedentary activity levels  (e.g., television watching or playing video games), engaging in higher-intensity  physical activity is associated with a lower waist circumference and less visceral fat. Several randomized controlled studies have shown that aerobic types of exercise are protective against age-related increases in visceral adiposity in growing children and adolescents. However, evidence regarding the effect of resistance training alone as a strategy for the treatment of abdominal obesity is lacking and warrants further investigation.},

	abstract = {Therapeutic education in diabetes helps patients take responsibility for self-control of their disease, and providing technological support systems facilitates this education. In this paper, we present an augmented reality game to support therapeutic education for patients with diabetes. Our game helps children (aged 5-14 years) to learn carbohydrate (carb) content of different foods. The game shows virtual foods on a real dish. The number of carb choices corresponding to the visualized food is also shown (1 carb choice = 10 grams of carbs). A study to determine the effectiveness of the game in terms of learning and perceived satisfaction and usability was carried out. A total of seventy children with diabetes participated in the study. From the results, we observed that the initial knowledge about carb choices of the children who participated in the study was low (a mean of 2 on a scale from 0 to 9). This indicates that therapeutic education for patients with diabetes is needed. When the results for  the pre-knowledge questionnaire and the post-knowledge questionnaire were compared, it was shown that the children learned about carb choices by playing our game. We used two post-knowledge questionnaires (one post-knowledge questionnaire that contained the same foods as the pre-knowledge questionnaire and a second post-knowledge questionnaire that contained foods that were different from the ones on the pre-knowledge questionnaire). There were no statistically significant differences between these two different post-knowledge  questionnaires. Moreover, the knowledge acquired was independent of gender and age. We also evaluated usability and perceived satisfaction. The children were satisfied with the game and considered that the game offers a high degree of usability. This game could be a valuable therapeutic education tool for patients  with diabetes.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Heart failure develops earlier and is more prevalent in blacks than whites because of their higher incidence of hypertension and diabetes and likely  subsequent diastolic dysfunction. Natriuretic peptides (NP) prevent cardiac malfunction through pressure, natriuresis action. However, whether race affects the relationships of NP action with cardiac function is unknown. METHODS: To assess this, 55 (21 whites and 27 males) normotensive adults underwent a 2-hour protocol of 40 minutes rest, video game stressor and recovery. Mitral inflow and  myocardial velocities (tissue Doppler) were recorded every 20 minutes. Blood pressure and heart rate were obtained at 10-minute intervals. Blood samples for pro-atrial NP and pro-brain NP (pro-BNP) were collected every 40 minutes. RESULTS: There were differences in the association between (1) the changes from rest to stress for E/A ratio and double product (whites, r = -0.42; blacks, r = 0. 10; P = 0.034 for difference between correlations); (2) stress E(m) and pro-atrial NP (whites, r = 0.59; blacks, r = -0.25; P = 0.025); (3) rest E(m) and BNP (whites, r = 0.83; blacks r = -0.17; P = 000); (4) rest E(m)/A(m) and pro-BNP (whites, r = 0.70; blacks, r = -0.42; P = 0.003); (5) rest E/E(m) and pro-BNP (whites, r = -0.61; blacks, r = 0.31; P = 0.015) and (6) stress E and pro-BNP (whites, r = 0.56; blacks, r = -0.18; P = 0.043). CONCLUSION: The higher correlations between levels of NP and diastolic function indices both at rest and stress suggest that NP protective action is more pronounced in whites than in blacks.},

	issn = {1079-0268 1079-0268},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Perhaps no other demographic group in the history of the United States has undergone such a significant transformation in the past several decades as that of our children. Societal trends have dramatically altered the nature of play and the way children interact with their environment. These trends have included a significant decrease in outdoor recreation, an increased dependence on electronic media, and the conceptual emergence of "time poverty". Consequently, childhood obesity and type 2 diabetes rates are skyrocketing because of the preponderance of sedentary lifestyles, and children are experiencing poor social skill development, less problem-solving abilities, and a marked increase in depression. For children with disabilities, such as spinal cord injuries (SCIs), these issues are even more significant. With a traumatic injury, the need for play and its therapeutic value becomes more important and yet is harder to attain. METHODS: Literature review. FINDINGS: In a study examining recreation involvement for 66 children and adolescents with SCI, the top 5 activities were all sedentary in nature, involving little to no social interaction and conducted indoors. Listening to music, reading, computer, video games, and television viewing are the top recreation activities for children and  adolescents with SCI. In addition, data collected in 2005 on "participation in organized community activities" for the pediatric SCI population found 203 of 326 patients reported no participation in sports, clubs, or youth centers after injury/diagnosis. An astonishing 62\% reported no organized activity at a time when participation in adult-supervised structured activities for able-bodied children is at an all-time high. Given these statistics, it is imperative that pediatric health care professionals understand societal trends and how they affect the SCI population. Making meaningful connections between these trends and the impact they have on children and adolescents with SCI will provide the theoretical framework for future solutions.},

	volume = {10},
	issn = {1838-2142 1838-2142},

	abstract = {REVIEW OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to synthesise the best available evidence on the effectiveness of web-based programs on the reduction of childhood obesity in school age children. BACKGROUND: Childhood obesity is one of the most serious public health challenges of the 21st century. The problem is global and is steadily affecting many low- and middle-income countries, particularly in urban settings.[1] The prevalence has increased at an alarming rate globally.[2] The International Association for the Study of Obesity; estimates that up to 200 million school aged children are either overweight or obese, of those 40-50 million are classified as obese. Obesity has negative health impact in childhood, as well as in the long term.Overweight and obesity are defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that may impair health. Body mass index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height that is commonly used to classify overweight and obesity. It is defined as a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of his/her height in meters (kg/m). The World Health Organization defines overweight as BMI greater than or equal to 25 and BMI greater than or equal to 30 as obesity. Children two years of age or older with a BMI between the 85 and 94 percentile on age-growth charts are considered overweight; children with a BMI greater than the 95 percentile are considered obese. BMI provides the most useful population-level measure of overweight and obesity as it is the same for both sexes and for all ages worldwide. Measures of  central obesity such as the waist:hip ratio and waist circumference can provide more robust indices of overall obesity-related health risk than BMI alone. A BMI  z-score is a quantitative measure of the deviation of a specific BMI percentile from the mean of that population. A positive z-score indicates a child is heavier than the mean and a negative z-score indicates a child is lighter than the mean.  Thus, a z-score compares the BMI of a given child to the BMI distribution for a population of children of the same age and sex.The incidence of obesity has more  than doubled since 1980. Overweight and obesity now ranks as the fifth leading global risk for mortality. Sixty-five percent of the world's population lives in  countries where childhood overweight and obesity kills more people than being underweight. In addition, 44\% of the diabetes burden, 23\% of the ischemic heart disease burden, and between 7\% and 41\% of certain cancer burdens are attributable to overweight and obesity.Childhood obesity continues to be a significant health  problem in the United States. There has been a rapid rise in obesity among the school-age population despite efforts made by Healthy People 2010 in promoting weight management and physical activity. These on-going efforts have been extended to be part of the goals for Healthy People 2020. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calculated that approximately 17\% children between the ages of two to nineteen years of age were at or above the 97 percentile for being obese. These figures are more than three times the anticipated 5\% set in the Healthy People 2010 report.Overweight and obese children are likely to stay obese into adulthood and are more likely to develop non-communicable diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular diseases at a younger  age. In addition to a higher risk of obesity and non-communicable diseases later  in life, affected children experience adverse outcomes such as breathing difficulties, increased risk of fractures, hypertension, and early markers of cardiovascular disease, different forms of cancers, insulin resistance, and psychological effects. Childhood obesity is associated with a higher chance of obesity, premature death, and disability in adulthood. If a child is overweight before eight years of age, obesity in adulthood is likely to be more severe.Child and adolescent obesity is also associated with increased risk of emotional problems. Teens with weight problems tend to have much lower self-esteem and are  less popular with their peers. Depression, anxiety, and obsessive compulsive disorder can also occur as a result of childhood obesity.In addition to the diseases associated with obesity, the economic consequences of obesity are enormous for families, health care systems, and the global economy. Direct medical costs include preventative, diagnostic, and treatment services related to overweight and associated co-morbidities. European nations spend 2-8\% of their health care budgets on obesity, equating to 0.6\% of their gross domestic product. In the United States, estimates based on 2008 data indicated that overweight and  obesity account for \$147 billion in total medical expenditure. This shows an increase from the \$117 billion spent in the year 2000.While indirect costs of overweight and obesity on society can be significantly higher, they are often overlooked. These costs stem from childhood obesity continuing on to obesity in adulthood, which can then results in income lost from decreased productivity, reduced opportunities and restricted activity, illness, absenteeism, and premature death. In addition, there are high costs associated with the numerous infrastructure changes that societies must make to cope with obese people such as reinforced beds, operating tables and wheel chairs; enlarged turnstiles and seats in in public gathering spaces; and modifications to transportation safety standards.Obesity is reaching pandemic proportions across much of the world, and  its consequences are set to impose unparalleled health, financial and social burdens on global society unless effective actions are taken to reverse the trend. Reducing the incidence of obesity in childhood can help children grow into adults with normal body weights and the tools necessary to sustain a health weight.Haerens, et al. explains the importance of school-based programs in dealing with the serious problem of childhood obesity and overweight. The school  setting is known as having a powerful influence on student's eating and physical  activities. Programs that may have a more positive impact are those that help increase physical activity and promote healthy foods in youth. Previous studies looking at the implementation of diet and exercise programs in schools were effective in changing food habits and increasing physical activity; however, few  of these studies showed a reduction in body weight. The Planet Health study, conducted over a period of two years, focused on healthy life style and showed a  reduction in obesity in girls but not in boys. The M-span study, a two-year study involving proper diet, exercise, and parental support showed a reduction of BMI only in boys. Haerens, et al. further explains that the above mentioned studies needed to be done in a more personalised manner in order to achieve more positive result; however, they are limited by the time consumption and financial demands necessary to carry out the proposed intervention.Haerens, et al. conducted a two  year study of the effect of a program including physical activity, healthy eating, and parental support with a computer-tailored component on BMI and BMI z-score in boys and girls. This intervention resulted in significant reduction in BMI in girls only. Carlson, et al. conducted a 12-month web-based weight loss intervention program which included physical activity and dietary behaviour. The  program was found to be a potential low cost method to positively impact public health and health behaviours. Furthermore, 55\% of the participants in the intervention group compared with 35\% in the control group made an improvement in  moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and diet. Doyle, et al. conducted an randomised controlled trial evaluating the effects of an Internet delivered program targeting weight loss on 80 overweight ethnically diverse 12-17 year olds. BMI z-scores were reduced in the intervention group compared with the usual care group post intervention and the intervention group maintained their reduction in BMI z-score at the four month follow up; however, statistical significance was not achieved at the four month follow up due to improvements in  weight loss in the usual care group over time.The United States Department of Health and Human Services report of 2009 indicates that school aged children spend an average of 7 hours and 11 minutes per day watching television, using a computer, and playing video games. Using these technology devices as educational  tools could have significant impact by increasing knowledge about healthy choices.Web-based technology has become part of our children's life in the last decade providing the foundation to a large number of daily activities. The use of web-based technology may be one method to provide a more personalised intervention to reduce obesity in school-aged children.The search for previously  conducted systematic reviews on the effectiveness of web based programs on obesity in children identified a systematic review conducted by An, et al., which included studies published between 1995 and April 2009. A critical appraisal of this systematic review determined it to be of reduced quality due to lack of transparency in reporting the details of the search strategy, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and assessment of the primary studies' methodological quality. The proposed systematic review will expand on the prior systematic review using the rigorous search strategy and assessment for methodological quality outlined below to identify the best available research to determine the effectiveness of web-based programs on childhood obesity. The current review will also seek to identify any more current research on the topic while expanding the  inclusion criteria from the internet-based interventions included in An, et al. to other forms for web-based technologies, such as smart phones, that have become increasingly popular with this population.The use of the web for communication purposes came into existence in 1991, but it was not really until the mid to late 1990's that information professionals understood its usefulness and the magnitude of a medium that would have far-reaching positive consequences. This systematic review will include studies published from 1991 to the present date to identify all relevant studies on this topic.},

	abstract = {Obesity and eating disorders are usually considered unrelated problems with different causes. However, various studies identify unhealthful weight-control behaviors (fasting, vomiting, or laxative abuse), induced by a negative experience of the body, as the common antecedents of both obesity and eating disorders. But how might negative body image--common to most adolescents, not only to medical patients--be behind the development of obesity and eating disorders? In this paper, I review the "allocentric lock theory" of negative body image as the possible antecedent of both obesity and eating disorders. Evidence from psychology and neuroscience indicates that our bodily experience involves the integration of different sensory inputs within two different reference frames: egocentric (first-person experience) and allocentric (third-person experience). Even though functional relations between these two frames are usually limited, they influence each other during the interaction between long- and short-term memory processes in spatial cognition. If this process is impaired either through exogenous (e.g., stress) or endogenous causes, the egocentric sensory inputs are unable to update the contents of the stored allocentric representation of the body. In other words, these patients are locked in an allocentric (observer view) negative image of their body, which their sensory inputs are no longer able to update even after a demanding diet and a significant weight loss. This article discusses the possible role of virtual reality in addressing this problem within an integrated treatment approach based on the allocentric lock theory.},

	abstract = {Virtual reality (VR), a system of human-computer interaction that allows researchers and clinicians to immerse people in virtual worlds, is gaining considerable traction as a research, education, and treatment tool. Virtual reality has been used successfully to treat anxiety disorders such as fear of flying and post-traumatic stress disorder, as an aid in stroke rehabilitation, and as a behavior modification aid in the treatment of attention deficit disorder. Virtual reality has also been employed in research on addictive disorders. Given the strong evidence that drug-dependent people are highly prone  to use and relapse in the presence of environmental stimuli associated with drug  use, VR is an ideal platform from which to study this relationship. Research using VR has shown that drug-dependent people react with strong craving to specific cues (e.g., cigarette packs, liquor bottles) as well as environments or  settings (e.g., bar, party) associated with drug use. Virtual reality has also been used to enhance learning and generalization of relapse prevention skills in  smokers by reinforcing these skills in lifelike environments. Obesity researchers and treatment professionals, building on the lessons learned from VR research in  substance abuse, have the opportunity to adapt these methods for investigating their own research and treatment questions. Virtual reality is ideally suited to  investigate the link between food cues and environmental settings with eating behaviors and self-report of hunger. In addition, VR can be used as a treatment tool for enhancing behavior modification goals to support healthy eating habits by reinforcing these goals in life-like situations.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The obesity is the disease of the new millennium, because it affects about 300 million people in the world, and especially it has a high prevalence in children. Obesity is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, problems of adaptation and relationship with other, lower self-esteem and depression. AIMS: The objective of our study is to identify children at risk of overweight/obesity in order to primary prevention. We have organized meetings with children, families and school's members where we discussed the results of our investigation about the importance of healthy diet and lifestyle. PATIENTS-METHODS: The study was carried out on 545 children (282F, 263M), age 6.-10 years, of two primary schools in Catanzaro, from 2008 to 2010. The valuation parameters were: gender, age, weight, height, blood pressure and waist circumference. To children were also administered a questionnaire about dietary habits and lifestyle. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Fisher's test. RESULTS: We had that 62\% of children was normal weight,  27\% overweight, 11\% obese. A particularly relevant datum is that the percentage of overweight-obese boys of 8 and 9 years old was higher (56\%) than that of normal weight. We found cases of hypertension only in obese children. 98\% of obese, 80\% of overweight and 24\% of normal weight children had a high waist circumference. We did not find differences in food quality among normal weight and overweight/obese children. Instead, we found significant differences in behavior between children: 90\% of obese, 64\% of overweight and 53\% of normal weight children passed more than 2 hours in the afternoon watching television, playing computer and video games. 70\% of normal weight, 82\% of overweight and 95\% of obese children practiced physical activity. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Our study shows a alarming fact about the increase of the obesity in children. In particular the most important problem is that this condition could predispose to  cardio-metabolic, endocrine, respiratory, musculoskeletal and psychological consequence. So it is important that everybody who lives with children, especially parents and school's members, educates children to have healthy lifestyles. These attentions may slow the worryng epidemic of obesity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In India, malnutrition has two ends. Under nutrition attracted the focus of health workers, as it is more prevalent. But over the past few years, childhood obesity is increasingly being observed with the changing lifestyle of families with increased purchasing power, increasing hours of inactivity due to television, video games and computers have replaced outdoor games and other social activities. Globally, an estimated 10\% of school-aged children, between 5  and 17 years of age, are overweight and obese. Obesity can be seen as first wave  of a defined cluster of non-communicable diseases called "New World Syndrome" creating an enormous socio-economic and public health burden in poorer countries. The most important consequence of childhood obesity is its persistence into adulthood with all its health risks like dyslipidemia, hyper-insulinemia, cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, osteoarthritis, gall bladder disease, hypertension and some sex hormone- sensitive cancers. The present study was, therefore, undertaken to determine the prevalence of overweight in high school students and to study the association between Body Mass Index (BMI) and cardiovascular efficiency. METHODOLOGY: A school based cross sectional study was  conducted in 2 schools of Nagpur. The total number of students included in the study was 565. Student's complete information regarding profile was taken in pretested questionnaire format after taking informed consent of parents. The anthropometric measurements of the students were done. Student's height and weight were measured and BMI was calculated. The student's cardiovascular efficiency was assessed with the help of Harvard step test. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The data was analyzed using Epi info version 3.4.1 software. Chi-square test was  used as test of significance and p value less than 0.05 was considered as significant. RESULTS: 90.97\% students belonged to 13, 14 and 15 years of age group. majority of the students belong to 14 years (33.81), followed by 13 years  (33.27) and 15 years (23.89) of age group respectively. The prevalence of overweight in students was 5.84\% and obesity was 0.35\%. The combined prevalence of overweight and obesity was 6.19\%. The prevalence of overweight in boys is 5.31\% and obesity was 0.63\% and that in girls is 6.53\% and 0\% respectively. The association between Harvard step test and overweight was found to be statistically significant (p\&lt; 0.000001). CONCLUSION: The total prevalence of overweight and obesity was 6.19\%. The association between Harvard step test and overweight was found to be statistically significant (p\&lt; 0.000001).},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Sedentary behaviour is associated with poorer mental health in adolescence but no studies have followed participants into mid-life. We investigated the association between after-school sedentary behaviours (screen time and homework) in adolescence with mental wellbeing in adulthood when participants were aged 42. METHODS: Participants (n=2038, 59.2\% female) were drawn from The 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70). At age 16 respondents were asked separate questions about how long they spent in three types of screen based activities (TV, video films, computer games) and homework 'after school yesterday'. Mental well-being and psychological distress were assessed at the age 42 sweep in 2012 using the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS) and Malaise Inventory, respectively. RESULTS: After adjustment for all covariates, participants reporting more than 3h of after school screen time as an adolescent  had -1.74 (95\% CI, -2.65, -0.83) points on the WEMWBS compared with adults reporting less than 1h screen time as an adolescent. Participants that reported high screen time both at age 16 ({\textgreater}/=3h/d) and age 42 ({\textgreater}/=3h/d TV viewing) demonstrated even lower scores (-2.91; -4.12, -1.69). Homework was unrelated to wellbeing after adjustment for covariates. The longitudinal association between adolescent screen time and adult psychological distress was attenuated to the null after adjustment for covariates. CONCLUSIONS: Screen time in adolescence was inversely associated with mental wellbeing in adulthood.},

	abstract = {Childhood obesity is nowadays considered as one of the major health problems that many societies suffer from. The obesity epidemic leads to several life threatening conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, and  mental health problems like depression, anxiety and loneliness just to mention a  few. Several approaches, including physical exercises, strict dietary, and exergames among others, have been adopted to address the obesity epidemic. Exergames are considered the innovative approach for fighting several health problem such as the obesity, where a combination of exercise and 3D gaming are proposed to incite kids to exercise as a team. Collaborative exergaming became even more popular given that it addresses the social side of the obesity epidemic, and it motivates kids to socialize with other kids. Traditional exergames are based on the client server approach where the server is responsible for streaming the 3D environment. However, this can lead to latency and server bottleneck if many clients participate in the exergame, which leads to the kids stopping exercising. Having an exergame application that does not suffer from networking problem such as delay, is very important given that it increases the exercise hours. In this work, we propose a new trend of mobile collaborative exergming applications that is based on the peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture, as well as two supplying partner selection protocols that aim at selecting the suitable source responsible for streaming the relevant 3D data. Our system, that  we refer to as MOSAIC, is intended for mobile collaborative exergames that incite kids to move inside a large area, using thin mobile devices such as head mounted  devices (HMD), have physical exercises, and collaborate with other kids which in  consequence address several health problems such as the obesity epidemic on the physical and social plans. Our proposed mobile collaborative exergame aims at inciting the kids to exercise as a team for a longer time by improving the quality of the streaming and reducing the delay. This is accomplished by our proposed supplying partner selection protocols that provide a quick discovery of  multiple supplying partners, by minimizing the time required the to acquire data. The performance evaluation we have obtained to evaluate our suite of protocols using a realistic set of exergame scenarios for obese kids is then presented and  discussed.},

	abstract = {A longstanding hypothesis is that individuals who exhibit large increases in blood pressure during psychological stress are at risk for atherosclerosis. We tested whether blood pressure changes during psychological stress predict subsequent coronary calcification (CaC) in young healthy adults. We evaluated 2816 healthy black and white women, 20 to 35 years of age, from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study, who were not using medication for  hypertension or diabetes in 1987-1988. Participants completed video game and star tracing tasks while their blood pressure was recorded. Thirteen years later (2000-2001), they completed computed tomography measures of CaC. Overall 9.3\% (261 of 2816) had CaC present at follow-up. Each 10 mm Hg change in systolic blood pressure during the video game was associated with a 24\% increased odds of  having CaC at follow-up (unadjusted odds ratio, 1.24; 95\% CI, 1.06 to 1.46; P=0.008). This association persisted after adjustment for age, race, sex, education, smoking, alcohol, family history of myocardial infarction, smoking, daily alcohol consumption, body mass index, and resting or baseline blood pressure (odds ratio, 1.31; 95\% CI, 1.08 to 1.58; P=0.006). Blood pressure changes during the star tracing task were not associated with subsequent CaC. Blood pressure changes during a video game predicted the presence of CaC 13 years later. To our knowledge, this is the first study that reports blood pressure reactivity to a stressor being related to calcification in the coronary arteries. Blood pressure reactivity may provide useful prognostic information about future  risk beyond standard risk factors.},

Currently, there is little evidence to support optimal strategies for management of T2DM in youth and the associated cardiovascular complications. Physical activity plays a powerful role in the prevention and management of T2DM and cardiovascular disease in adults. This review will focus on the role of physical activity for the prevention of T2DM in  youth and its associated cardiovascular complications. The first part describes the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in this cohort. The second part focuses on the role of physical activity in the prevention and management of T2DM in youth. Collectively, the limited intervention and observation studies published to date suggest that daily targets of 60-90 minutes of physical activity and less than 60 minutes of screen time (i.e. time spent in front of a television, computer or video games) are required for the prevention and management of T2DM in youth. Large-scale intervention studies are needed to determine the most effective physical activity strategies for the prevention and  management of T2DM in youth.},

Anthropometric data of 11,190 elementary schoolchildren (aged 13) were retrospectively tracked from 2003 to 2009, and classified into two groups: Normal (N = 9793) and Metabolic Disorders (N = 1397), based on the disease category of their parents (under at least one medication for stroke, coronary heart disease (CAD), diabetes, and hypertension). Schoolchildren's weekly time spending on reading, computer use, video game, music listening, radio listening, TV watching, and movie watching, was reported with parental assistance via questionnaires. Baseline BMI and 6 years BMI progression  rate in Metabolic Disorders group were significantly higher than those in Normal  group. In particular, offsprings from stroke parents exhibited the greatest baseline BMI across 6 years compared to the rest of the disease categories. For Metabolic Disorders group, time spending on computer use, video game, TV watching, and music listening of schoolchildren was significantly longer than Normal group. Reading, which occupied the largest portion of weekly sedentary time, was not contributed to the group difference on the BMI status of schoolchildren. The current study demonstrates that schoolchildren from family with at least one parent having metabolic disorders, particularly stroke, tend to be more sedentary and heavior than their age-matched normal peers. School-based obesity prevention programs are suggested for this specific group by restricting  time spent on technology-associated sedentary behaviors and promoting sport activities.},

Random screening is not effective in identifying children at risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); therefore, there is a need to apply screening strategies that guide the development of appropriate primary prevention efforts.  To assess the prevalence of risk factors for T2DM, 1066 fifth-grade children were screened using American Diabetes Association guidelines. Overall, 22.6\% were found at risk; African American and Hispanic children were almost 8 times more likely to be at risk when compared to Caucasians (odds ratio = 7.41 and 7.87). Children who reported watching TV/playing video games 2 or more hours/day were 73\% more likely to be at risk. Children identified to be at risk were referred to their primary care provider and were invited to participate in a counseling session. The environmental risk factors for T2DM identified in this study are modifiable and should be targeted in preventive interventions at the school and community level to reduce overweight and consequently prevent T2DM in children, especially among minority children.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity is associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes. A key obstacle to physical activity is lack of motivation. Although some interactive exercise games (i.e., exergames--video games that require physical exertion in order to play) motivate players to exercise more, few games take advantage of group dynamics to motivate players' duration of exercise. In a test  of the Kohler motivation gain effect, this study varied the ability level of a virtually presented partner in an interactive exergame that focused on abdominal  strength to identify effects on a subject's (S') persistence with the task. METHOD: Male (n = 63) and female (n = 72) undergraduate students were randomly assigned to one of four conditions (individual control or low-, moderate-, or high- partner discrepancy) in a conditions x gender factorial design and tested on a series of isometric abdominal exercises using PlayStation 2 EyeToy: Kinetic  software. They performed the first series of five exercises alone (trial block 1), and after a rest period, those in the partner conditions performed remaining  trials (trial block 2) with a same-sex virtually presented partner whom they could observe during their performance, while those in the individual control condition performed the remaining trials alone. In the partner conditions, the partner's performance was manipulated to be always better than the S's, the exact difference depending on the discrepancy condition. The partnered tasks were conjunctive; that is, success in the game depended on the performance of the weaker team member. Persistence, the outcome measure for this study, consisted of the total number of seconds the S held the exercise position. RESULTS: Using planned orthogonal contrasts on difference scores between blocks 1 and 2, results showed that persistence was significantly (p {\textless} .001) greater in all experimental  conditions with a virtually presented partner (M = 33.59 s) than in the individual control condition (M = -49.04 s). Subjects demonstrated more persistence in the moderate-discrepancy condition (M = 51.36 s) than in the low-discrepancy condition (M = 22.52 s) or the high-discrepancy condition (M = 26.89 s). A significant quadratic trend confirmed the expected inverted-U function relating partner discrepancy and persistence (p = .025). Although Ss persisted longer and had higher heart rate in partnered conditions, they did not  perceive their exertion to be any higher than those in the individual condition.  CONCLUSIONS: Virtually presented partners who are moderately more capable than participants are the most effective at improving persistence in exergame tasks.},

The purpose of this qualitative metasynthesis was to explore parent, youth, and educational professionals' perceptions of barriers to, and facilitators of, reducing youth screen time. METHOD: Qualitative metasynthesis techniques were used to analyze and synthesize 15 qualitative studies of screen time among youth (11-18 years) meeting inclusion criteria. The  phrases, quotes, and/or author interpretations (i.e., theme or subtheme) were recorded in a data display matrix to facilitate article comparisons. Codes were collapsed into 23 categories of similar conceptual meaning and 3 overarching themes were derived using thematic analysis procedures. RESULTS: Study sample sizes ranged from 6 to 270 participants from 6 countries. Data collection methods included focus groups (n = 6), interviews (n = 4), focus group and interviews (n  = 4), and naturalistic observation (n = 1) with youth and/or parents. Data analysis techniques included thematic analysis (n = 9), content analysis (n = 3), grounded theory (n = 1), observation (n = 1), and interpretive phenomenological analysis (n = 1). Three thematic categories were identified: (a) youth's norms-screen time is an integral part of daily life, and facilitates opportunities for entertainment, social interaction, and escapism; (b) family dynamics and parental roles-parents are conflicted and send mixed messages about  the appropriate uses and amounts of screen time; and, (c) resources and environment-engagement in screen time is dependent on school, community, neighborhood, and home environmental contexts. CONCLUSIONS: Screen time is an established norm in many youth cultures, presenting barriers to behavior change.  Parents recognize the importance of reducing youth screen time, but model and promote engagement themselves. For youth and parents, mutually agreed rules, limits, and parental monitoring of screen time were perceived as likely to be effective.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Individuals with diabetic peripheral neuropathy frequently experience concomitant impaired proprioception and postural instability. Conventional exercise training has been demonstrated to be effective in improving balance but  does not incorporate visual feedback targeting joint perception, which is an integral mechanism that helps compensate for impaired proprioception in diabetic  peripheral neuropathy. METHODS: This prospective cohort study recruited 29 participants (mean +/- SD: age, 57 +/- 10 years; body mass index [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared], 26.9 +/- 3.1). Participants satisfying the inclusion criteria performed predefined ankle exercises through reaching tasks, with visual feedback from the ankle joint projected on a screen. Ankle motion in the mediolateral and anteroposterior directions was captured using wearable sensors attached to the participant's shank. Improvements in postural stability were quantified by measuring center of  mass sway area and the reciprocal compensatory index before and after training using validated body-worn sensor technology. RESULTS: Findings revealed a significant reduction in center of mass sway after training (mean, 22\%; P = .02). A higher postural stability deficit (high body sway) at baseline was associated with higher training gains in postural balance (reduction in center of mass sway) (r = -0.52, P {\textless} .05). In addition, significant improvement was observed in postural coordination between the ankle and hip joints (mean, 10.4\%; P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: The present research implemented a novel balance rehabilitation strategy based on virtual reality technology. The method included wearable sensors and an interactive user interface for real-time visual feedback based on  ankle joint motion, similar to a video gaming environment, for compensating impaired joint proprioception. These findings support that visual feedback generated from the ankle joint coupled with motor learning may be effective in improving postural stability in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy.},

Caucasian youth (n 630) aged 8-10 years at recruitment,  with at least one obese biological parent, were studied (QUebec Adipose and Lifestyle InvesTigation in Youth cohort). IS was measured using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) of insulin resistance and Matsuda IS index. ISct was measured using HOMA2\%-beta, the ratio of the AUC of insulin:glucose over the first 30 min (AUC I/G(t= 30 min)) of the oral glucose tolerance test and AUC I/G(t= 120 min) over 2 h. Fitness was measured using VO(2)(peak), percentage of fat mass by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and 7 d MVPA using accelerometry; screen time (ST) by average daily hours of self-reported television, video game or computer use. Dietary composition was measured using three non-consecutive dietary recalls. Non-parametric smoothing splines were used to model non-linear associations; all models were adjusted for age, sex, season, pubertal stage, MVPA, fitness, ST and adiposity. The percentage of total daily energy from dietary protein, fat, saturated fat and carbohydrate and the consumption of dietary vitamin D, sugar-sweetened beverages, fibre and portions of fruits and vegetables were taken into consideration. No dietary component was associated with any measure of IS after adjusting for MVPA, fitness, ST and adiposity. For every 1\% increase in daily protein intake (\%), AUC I/G(t= 30 min) decreased by 1.1\% (P= 0.033). Otherwise, dietary composition was not associated with ISct. While long-term excess of energy intake has been shown to lead to overweight and  obesity, dietary macronutrient composition is not independently correlated with IS or ISct in youth.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sedentary behavior is defined as any waking behavior characterized by an energy expenditure of 1.5 METS or less while in a sitting or reclining posture. This study examines this definition by assessing the energy cost (METs)  of common sitting, standing and walking tasks. METHODS: Fifty one adults spent 10 min during each activity in a variety of sitting tasks (watching TV, Playing on the Wii, Playing on the PlayStation Portable (PSP) and typing) and non-sedentary  tasks (standing still, walking at 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, and 1.6 mph). Activities were completed on the same day in a random order following an assessment of resting metabolic rate (RMR). A portable gas analyzer was used to measure oxygen uptake, and data were converted to units of energy expenditure (METs). RESULTS: Average of standardized MET values for screen-based sitting tasks were: 1.33 (SD: 0.24) METS (TV), 1.41 (SD: 0.28) (PSP), and 1.45 (SD: 0.32) (Typing). The more active, yet still seated, games on the Wii yielded an average  of 2.06 (SD: 0.5) METS. Standing still yielded an average of 1.59 (SD: 0.37) METs. Walking MET values increased incrementally with speed from 2.17 to 2.99 (SD: 0.5 - 0.69) METs. CONCLUSIONS: The suggested 1.5 MET threshold for sedentary behaviors seems reasonable however some sitting based activities may be classified as non-sedentary. The effect of this on the definition of sedentary behavior and associations with metabolic health needs further investigation.},

To this aim, electroencephalographic data were recorded in 14 expert, 15 amateur and 15 young elite right-handed table tennis players. All subjects watched videos of a serve and imagined themselves responding with a specific table tennis stroke. With reference to a baseline period, power decrease/increase of the sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) during the pretask- and task period indexed the cortical activation/deactivation (event-related desynchronization/synchronization, ERD/ERS). Regarding hypothesis  (1), 8-10 Hz SMR ERD was stronger in elite athletes than in amateurs with an intermediate ERD in young elite athletes in the motor cortex. Regarding hypothesis (2), there was no correlation between ERD/ERS in the motor cortex and  world rank points in elite experts, but a weaker ERD in the fronto-parietal cortex was associated with higher world rank points. These results suggest that motor skill in table tennis is associated with focused excitability of the motor  cortex during reaction, movement planning and execution with high attentional demands. Among elite experts, less activation of the fronto-parietal attention network may be necessary to become a world champion.},

	abstract = {About one third of adolescents in the USA are overweight and/or obese. Obesity during the adolescent years is associated with many adverse health consequences,  including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and psychosocial problems. Because of substantial advances in technologies and wide acceptance by  adolescents, it is now possible to use technology for healthy weight management and prevention of obesity. This systematic review used Preferred Reporting Items  for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and aimed to evaluate the existing literature reported on the effectiveness of technology-based intervention (web-based, e-learning, and active video games) in preventing obesity in adolescents. The primary aim of this review was to explore if components of specific interventions were associated with a reduction in body mass index. Research articles obtained from CINAHL, Embase, PubMed, PsycInfo, and the Cochrane database from1990 to 2014 were reviewed. A total of 131 published articles were identified, and 14 met the inclusion criteria of a randomized or nonrandomized clinical study with body mass index as primary outcome and/or secondary outcomes of diet/physical activity and/or psychosocial function, tested lifestyle interventions to prevent obesity, used technology, and studied adolescents (aged 12-18 years). The results indicated that six of 14 studies found body mass index and/or body fat decreased at short-term (less than 12 months) follow-up. Six of eleven studies that examined physical activity or physical activity-related outcomes found an improved physical activity outcome (time playing active video games and increase in physical activity time), while five of seven studies which assessed dietary outcomes indicated improvement in dietary behaviors. Five of seven studies suggested an improvement in psychosocial function (reduced depression, improved self-esteem and efficacy, improvement on Behavior Assessment Scale) in adolescents involved in the technology-based intervention. All effective interventions utilized dietary and physical activity  strategies as part of intervention components. Because of the variation in duration of intervention (range 10 weeks to 2 years), it is not clear what length of intervention is most effective. Future research should assess the long-term impact of technology-based interventions and evaluate mediators and moderators for weight change in adolescents.},

Interventions to prevent their development and exacerbation are needed. Casual video games (CVGs) are fun, easy to play, spontaneous and tremendously popular. People report that they play these games because they decrease their stress and improve their mood. This study tested this theory by comparing people  playing Bejeweled II a popular CVG with control subjects measured under similar conditions. Electroencephalographic (EEG) changes after playing Bejeweled II were consistent with increased mood and corroborated with similar findings on psychological reports. Moreover, heart rate variability (HRV) changes consistent  with autonomic nervous system relaxation or decreased physical stress were also recorded. It is concluded, therefore, that playing a CVG like Bejeweled II can increase mood and decrease stress. These finding have broad implications and include the potential development of prescriptive interventions using Bejeweled II to prevent and treat stress related medical disorders. Finally, these findings demonstrate a method using EEG, HRV and psychological correlates to understand the psychophysiological or cybernetic interconnection between participant and video game.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) are followed by primary care physicians, who often lack knowledge or confidence to prescribe insulin properly. This contributes to clinical inertia and poor glycemic control. Effectiveness of traditional continuing medical education (CME) to solve that is  limited, so new approaches are required. Electronic games are a good option, as they can be very effective and easily disseminated. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to assess applicability, user acceptance, and educational effectiveness of InsuOnline, an electronic serious game for medical education on  insulin therapy for DM, compared with a traditional CME activity. METHODS: Primary care physicians (PCPs) from South of Brazil were invited by phone or email to participate in an unblinded randomized controlled trial and randomly allocated to play the game InsuOnline, installed as an app in their own computers, at the time of their choice, with minimal or no external guidance, or  to participate in a traditional CME session, composed by onsite lectures and cases discussion. Both interventions had the same content and duration ({\textasciitilde}4 h). Applicability was assessed by the number of subjects who completed the assigned intervention in each group. Insulin-prescribing competence (factual knowledge, problem-solving skills, and attitudes) was self-assessed through a questionnaire  applied before, immediately after, and 3 months after the interventions. Acceptance of the intervention (satisfaction and perceived importance for clinical practice) was also assessed immediately after and 3 months after the interventions, respectively. RESULTS: Subjects' characteristics were similar between groups (mean age 38, 51.4\% [69/134] male). In the game group, 69 of 88 (78\%) completed the intervention, compared with 65 of 73 (89\%) in the control group, with no difference in applicability. Percentage of right answers in the competence subscale, which was 52\% at the baseline in both groups, significantly  improved immediately after both interventions to 92\% in the game group and to 85\% in control (P{\textless}.001). After 3 months, it remained significantly higher than that at the baseline in both groups (80\% in game, and 76\% in control; P{\textless}.001). Absolute increase in competence score was better with the game (40\%) than with traditional CME (34\%; P=.01). Insulin-related attitudes were improved both after  the game (significant improvement in 4 of 9 items) and after control activity (3  of 9). Both interventions were very well accepted, with most subjects rating them as "fun or pleasant," "useful," and "practice-changing." CONCLUSIONS: The game InsuOnline was applicable, very well accepted, and highly effective for medical education on insulin therapy. In view of its flexibility and easy dissemination,  it is a valid option for large-scale CME, potentially helping to reduce clinical  inertia and to improve quality of care for DM patients.

Because of the associations screen time has with dietary intake, diet may be an important factor in the screen time and health relationship; however, evidence has not previously been synthesized. Thus, the aim of this systematic review was to explore whether the associations between various sedentary behaviours and cardiometabolic risk markers are independent of  dietary intake in adolescents. Online databases and personal libraries were searched for peer-reviewed original research articles published in English before March 2014. Included studies assessed associations between sedentary behaviour and cardiometabolic markers in 12- to 18-year-olds and adjusted for dietary intake. Twenty-five studies met the inclusion criteria. From the 21 studies examining sedentary behaviour and adiposity, the majority found significant positive associations between television viewing, screen time and self-reported overall sedentary behaviour with markers of adiposity, independent of dietary intake. No significant associations between screen time with blood pressure and cholesterol were reported. Sedentary behaviour appears to be associated with adiposity in adolescents, irrespective of dietary intake. However, the variability of dietary variables between studies suggests further work is needed  to understand the role of dietary intake when examining these associations in youth.},

DESIGN: This was a hospital-based cross-sectional study. METHODS: A study of 122 children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes was conducted over an 8-month period. Self-reported physical activity  time and time spent watching TV or playing computer or video games were obtained  using interviewer-administered questionnaires. Retinal vascular caliber was measured by a trained grader using a standardized protocol and later summarized as central retinal artery equivalent (CRAE) and central retinal vein equivalent (CRVE) using a semiautomated computer program. RESULTS: After adjusting for confounders (age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, HbA1c, maternal smoking status, age at which cow's milk was introduced, and CRVE/CRAE, respectively), narrower CRAE was independently related to more time spent playing computer/video games [ExpB = -3.85; 95\% confidence interval (CI), -6.41 to -1.29; P = 0.004], whereas wider CRVE was independently related to lower physical activity level (ExpB = -1.08; 95\% CI, -2.01 to -0.15; P = 0.03) and more time spent playing computer/video games (ExpB = 4.72; 95\% CI, 0.52-8.92; P = 0.02). Television viewing time was not associated with retinal vascular caliber after adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that physical activity and sedentary behaviors in the form of "screen viewing time" are associated with retinal vessel caliber early in life. These results suggest that  retinal vascular caliber may provide prognostic information beyond current traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Future longitudinal and interventional studies are warranted to evaluate the relevance of these observations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The majority of patients with overweight and type 2 diabetes show insufficient levels of daily physical activity (PA) and usually are among the least likely to engage in or adhere to any form of generic PA. Active video games (exergames) may be a solution to motivate these individuals to overcome their sedentary lifestyle. OBJECTIVES: This systematic review was conducted to review the current evidence for the effectiveness of exergaming in overweight and type 2 diabetes mellitus and thus to evaluate the suitability of these games to be used  as tools for exercise promotion that meet current PA guidelines. METHODS: We searched electronic bibliographic databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, OpenGrey, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) up to March 2015. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) and cross-sectional studies published in English in a peer-reviewed journal and analyzing the effects of exergames on objectively measured intensity parameters of PA in overweight (body mass index [BMI] {\textgreater}/=25 kg/m(2)) adults (mean age {\textgreater}/=18 years) with and without type 2 diabetes were included. Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment  were performed independently by two review authors. Primary outcomes included changes in oxygen uptake (VO2), energy expenditure (EE), heart rate (HR), or activity counts. Secondary outcomes were enjoyment of treatment, exercise adherence, ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), changes in body composition, and  changes in blood parameters (serum glucose, long-term blood glucose, blood cholesterol, triglycerides, or serum lactate). RESULTS: Of 2845 records, 14 publications (11 studies) met the inclusion criteria. All included studies (ten experimental, cross-sectional laboratory studies and one RCT) were able to show increases in either VO2, EE, HR, or activity counts. However, effects of exergaming in terms of changes in these intensity parameters varied significantly between game modes and consoles as well as because of the vastly differing durations of exergame activity between studies. One of the included studies had a low risk of bias, and three had a high risk of bias; seven studies had an unclear risk of bias as the study description was insufficient. No studies were found investigating the changes in objectively measured PA intensity parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSION: This review suggests that exergames are able to increase PA among overweight individuals. However, the inconsistent results and the overall poor or moderate methodological quality do not permit judgment on whether exergames are suitable to meet PA guidelines in this target group. The lack of research regarding the effects of exergames in type 2 diabetes indicates a great need for future research.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exergames (i.e., video games that require gross motor activity) may provide intrinsically motivating experiences that engage youth in sustained physical activity. METHOD: Thirty-one low-income 15- to 19-year-old overweight and obese African American adolescents were randomly assigned to a competitive exergame (n = 17) or a cooperative exergame (n = 14) condition. Participants played a preassigned Wii Active exergame routine that took between 30 and 60 min  each school day, and sessions occurred during lunch time or an after-school program over a 6 month period. Participation was voluntary, so students decided whether to come or not on a given day. Cooperative exergame players worked together with a peer to expend calories and earn points, while competitive exergame players competed individually against a peer to expend calories and earn points. Motivation was measured through surveys and interviews at the end of the  intervention, and energy expenditure was measured by accelerometry during game play. RESULTS: Compared with the competitive group, the cooperative players were  significantly more intrinsically motivated to play (p = .034, partial eta-squared = 0.366) and more psychologically attracted to the design of the exergame (p = .034, partial eta-squared = 0.320). Intrinsic motivation was significantly positively correlated with energy expenditure during game play: individuals who were motivated by control/choice had higher energy expenditure (p = .026), and those who were more goal motivated (p = .004) and more immersed in game play (p = .024) had lower energy expenditure during game play. CONCLUSIONS: Cooperative exergame play produced higher intrinsic motivation to play the exergame than competitive exergame play did. Intrinsic motivation that came from a desire for control/choice was related to higher energy expenditure during game play. Cooperative exergame play holds promise as a method for engaging overweight and obese youth in physical activity.},

The current review systematically identified and evaluated electronic media-based interventions that focused on promoting health and safety behavior change in youth. OBJECTIVE: To assess the type and quality of the studies evaluating the effects of electronic media-based interventions on health and safety behavior change. EVIDENCE REVIEW: Studies were identified from searches in MEDLINE (1950 through September 2010) and PsycINFO (1967 through September 2010). The review included published studies of interventions that used electronic media and focused on changes in behavior related to health or safety in children aged 18 years or younger. FINDINGS: Nineteen studies met the criteria and focused on at least 1 behavior change outcome. The focus was interventions related to physical activity and/or nutrition in 7 studies, on asthma in 6, safety behaviors in 3, sexual risk behaviors in 2, and diabetes mellitus in 1. Seventeen studies reported at least 1 statistically significant effect on behavior change outcomes, including an increase in fruit, juice, or vegetable consumption; an increase in physical activity; improved asthma self-management; acquisition of street and fire safety skills; and sexual abstinence. Only 5 of the 19 studies were rated as excellent. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our systematic review suggests that interventions using electronic media can improve health and safety behaviors in young persons, but there is a need for higher-quality, rigorous interventions that promote behavior change.},

This review provides examples of technologies used to support nutrition and physical activity behaviors in the context of DSM. Technologies covered include those widely used for DSM, such as web-based programs and mobile  phone and smartphone applications. In addition, examples of novel tools such as virtual and augmented reality, video games, computer vision for dietary carbohydrate monitoring, and wearable devices are provided. The challenges to, and facilitators for, the use of eHealth technologies in DSM are discussed. Strategies to support the implementation of eHealth technologies within practice  and suggestions for future research to enhance nutrition and physical activity behaviors as a part of broader DSM are provided.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physicians lack of knowledge contributes to underuse of insulin and poor glycemic control in adults with diabetes mellitus (DM). Traditional continuing medical education have limited efficacy, and new approaches are required. OBJECTIVE: We report the design of a trial to assess the educational efficacy of InsuOnline, a game for education of primary care physicians (PCPs). The goal of InsuOnline was to improve appropriate initiation and adjustment of insulin for the treatment of DM. InsuOnline was designed to be educationally adequate, self-motivating, and attractive. METHODS: A multidisciplinary team of endocrinologists, experts in medical education, and programmers, was assembled for the design and development of InsuOnline. Currently, we are conducting usability and playability tests, with PCPs and medical students playing the game  on a desktop computer. Adjustments will be made based on these results. An unblinded randomized controlled trial with PCPs who work in the city of Londrina, Brazil, will be conducted to assess the educational validity of InsuOnline on the Web. In this trial, 64 PCPs will play InsuOnline, and 64 PCPs will undergo traditional instructional activities (lecture and group discussion). Knowledge on how to initiate and adjust insulin will be assessed by a Web-based multiple choice questionnaire, and attitudes regarding diabetes/insulin will be assessed by Diabetes Attitude Scale 3 at 3 time points-before, immediately after, and 6 months after the intervention. Subjects general impressions on the interventions  will be assessed by a questionnaire. Software logs will be reviewed. RESULTS: To  our knowledge, this is the first research with the aim of assessing the educational efficacy of a computer game for teaching PCPs about insulin therapy in DM. We describe the development criteria used for creating InsuOnline. Evaluation of the game using a randomized controlled trial design will be done in future studies. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that the design and development of a game for PCPs education on insulin is possible with a multidisciplinary team. InsuOnline can be an attractive option for large-scale continuous medical education to help improving PCPs knowledge on insulin therapy and potentially improving DM patients care.

This narrative review provides an overview of recent evidence in this area and highlights research gaps. Current evidence suggests that North American children and youth spend between 40\% and 60\% of their waking hours engaging in sedentary pursuits. Although data are lacking concerning temporal trends of objectively measured sedentary time, self-reported  sedentary behaviours have increased over the past half century, with a rapid increase since the late 1990s. Excessive sedentary behaviour has been found to have independent and deleterious associations with markers of adiposity and cardiometabolic disease risk. These associations are especially consistent for screen-based sedentary behaviours (TV viewing, computer games, etc), with more conflicting findings observed for overall sedentary time. The above associations  are possibly mediated by the influence of screen-based sedentary behaviours on energy intake. Although excessive sitting has been reported to have adverse acute and chronic metabolic impacts in adults, research on children is lacking. Research is particularly needed to investigate the impact of characteristics of sedentary behaviour (i.e. type/context, sedentary bout length, breaks in sedentary time, etc), as well as interventions that examine the health and behavioural impacts of sitting per se.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This quasi-experimental study investigated a game intervention--specifically, an alternate reality game (ARG)--as a means to influence college students' physical activity (PA). An ARG is an interactive narrative that takes place in the real world and uses multiple media to reveal a  story. METHOD: Three sections of a college health course (n = 115 freshman students) were assigned either to a game group that played the ARG or to a comparison group that learned how to use exercise equipment in weekly laboratory  sessions. Pre- and post-intervention measures included weight, waist circumference, body mass index (BMI), percentage body fat (PBF), and self-reported moderate physical activity (MPA) and vigorous physical activity (VPA), and PA (steps/week). RESULTS: A significant group x time interaction (p =  .001) was detected for PA, with a significant increase in PA for the game (p {\textless} .001) versus a significant decrease (p = .001) for the comparison group. Significant within-group increases for weight (p = .001), BMI (p = .001), and PBF (p = .001) were detected. A significant group x time interaction (p = .001) was detected when analyzing self-reported VPA, with both groups reporting decreases in VPA over time; however, the decrease was only significant for the comparison group (p {\textless} .001). No significant group differences were found for MPA. CONCLUSIONS: It is important that any intervention meet the needs and interests of its target population. Here, the ARG was designed in light of the learning preferences of today's college students--collaborative and social, experiential and media-rich. Our results provide preliminary evidence that a game intervention can positively influence PA within the college student population.},

This study assessed the acceptability and applicability of Diab among Hong Kong Chinese children, whether the Diab story was understood by them, and whether it had potential to influence them both during the game and afterward. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Thirty-four students (21 males, 13 females) 9-12 years of age were included. Upon completion of all the Diab episodes, children completed an immersion scale with 18 items, as well as an individual interview with 10 open-ended questions. RESULTS: Children achieved average immersion after playing Diab with the mean score at 39.1 (standard deviation = 9.0), higher than the median (36) of possible scores (range, 18-54).  Four themes using framework analysis emerged from the interviews, including intuitive feelings about the interface, playing experience, perception of the effect of Diab on behavior change, and the applicability of Diab to Hong Kong children. The story and game developed for American children were found acceptable and applicable to Hong Kong Chinese children. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of quantitative and qualitative methods confirmed the acceptability and applicability of Diab to Hong Kong Chinese children.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes has increased in prevalence among youth, paralleling  the increase in pediatric obesity. Helping youth achieve energy balance by changing diet and physical activity behaviors should decrease the risk for type 2 diabetes and obesity. Goal setting and goal review are critical components of behavior change. Theory-informed video games that emphasize development and refinement of goal setting and goal review skills provide a method for achieving  energy balance in an informative, entertaining format. This article reports alpha-testing results of early versions of theory-informed goal setting and reviews components of two diabetes and obesity prevention video games for preadolescents. METHOD: Two episodes each of two video games were alpha tested with 9- to 11-year-old youth from multiple ethnic groups. Alpha testing included  observed game play followed by a scripted interview. The staff was trained in observation and interview techniques prior to data collection. RESULTS: Although  some difficulties were encountered, alpha testers generally understood goal setting and review components and comprehended they were setting personal goals.  Although goal setting and review involved multiple steps, youth were generally able to complete them quickly, with minimal difficulty. Few technical issues arose; however, several usability and comprehension problems were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Theory-informed video games may be an effective medium for promoting youth diabetes and obesity prevention. Alpha testing helps identify problems likely to have a negative effect on functionality, usability, and comprehension during development, thereby providing an opportunity to correct these issues prior to final production.},

However, type-1 diabetic children have not appreciated traditional learning methods since they rarely contain the elements of fun and interactivity. In this study, we developed, implemented and evaluated a preliminary version of edutainment tools for initial education for type-1 diabetic children. METHODS: Three games running on either personal computer (PC) and GameBoy Advance were developed. All games were designed to educate patients about relationships among food (carbohydrate), plasma glucose level, exercise, and insulin dose. A total of 58 testers evaluated degree of entertainment, usability and clinical usefulness of the games. RESULTS: Generally, testers felt all games were intuitive and fun and the usability of games was highly scored. More than 90\% of testers showed an interest in the edutainment approach, and approximately 60\% agreed that these games could provide attractive educational environment compared to traditional education, especially  for children. CONCLUSIONS: Our edutainment systems were accepted as attractive learning tools for type-1 diabetic children who need initial education.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Despite extensive evidence showing that lifestyle habits play a critical role in preventing or delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes in adults, little is known regarding the impact of lifestyle habits on type 2 diabetes risk  in childhood. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether adiposity, fitness, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, and screen time predict insulin sensitivity or insulin secretion during a 2-year period in children with a family history of obesity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This is a prospective longitudinal cohort study of 630 children, having at least 1 obese parent, recruited from schools in Quebec, Canada, between July 2005 and December 2008 in  the Quebec Adipose and Lifestyle Investigation in Youth (QUALITY) cohort. Children were assessed at baseline (ages 8-10 years) and 2 years later. Fitness was measured by peak oxygen consumption, percentage of body fat (adiposity) by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity using accelerometry, and screen time by average daily hours of self-reported television, video game, or computer use. Regression models were adjusted for age, sex, season, and pubertal stage. The current analysis was completed in October 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Insulin sensitivity was measured by the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance and an oral glucose tolerance  test-based index (Matsuda insulin sensitivity index). Insulin secretion was measured using the area under the curve of insulin to glucose during the first 30 minutes of the oral glucose tolerance test and using the area under the curve of  insulin to glucose over 2 hours. RESULTS: Of 630 children evaluated at baseline (mean [SD] age, 9.6 [0.9] years; 54.4\% male; 56.2\% normal weight, 19.2\% overweight, and 22.7\% obese), 564 were evaluated at 2-year follow-up. Adiposity and changes in adiposity were the central predictors of insulin dynamics over time. Every additional 1\% of body fat at ages 8 to 10 years decreased insulin sensitivity by 2.9\% (95\% CI, -3.3\% to -2.5\%; P {\textless} .001) and led to a 0.5\% (95\% CI, 0.09\% to 0.8\%; P = .02) increased requirement in the area under the curve of insulin to glucose during the first 30 minutes of the oral glucose tolerance test 2 years later. Higher levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and lower  screen time appear to be beneficial to insulin sensitivity in part through their  effect on adiposity levels. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Adiposity plays a determining role in cardiometabolic health at a young age. Public health strategies that promote healthy body weight, notably physical activity, need to target school-aged and possibly younger children.},

METHODS: On the basis of a structured survey among the European SWEET members information on established tools and programs in national languages were analyzed using an extensive literature and desk search. These were differentiated according to five age-groups and five target groups (young people with diabetes, parents, and other close relations, carers in school and nursery, and healthcare professionals). RESULTS: Responses and original tools were received from 11 SWEET countries reflecting the European status in 2011. More or less structured information for parents, close relations, and carers in school or nursery are available in all 11 participating countries. However, only two countries followed the recommendations of having published a structured, curriculum lead, and evaluated program for different age-groups and carers. One of these was evaluated nationwide and funded by the respective National Health Care System after accreditation. In addition a  huge variety of creative tools, e.g., booklets, leaflets, games, videos, and material for educating children of different age-groups and their parents are available - but most of them are not linked to a structured education program. CONCLUSIONS: Harmonizing and integrating these materials into quality assured structured holistic national education programs will be an important future task  for the ongoing SWEET project.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a pilot study with 41 undergraduate medical students and Internal Medicine residents to assess the educational effectiveness of InsuOnline(c), as compared to a traditional educational activity (lecture, cases discussion). Knowledge, skills and beliefs on insulin therapy were evaluated by a questionnaire applied before, immediately after, and 3 months after both interventions. RESULTS: Mean knowledge/skills score was improved from 68\% to 89\%  in traditional education group (n = 23; p {\textless} 0.001), and from 61\% to 90\% in game group (n = 18; p {\textless} 0.001). After 3 months, mean score decreased (to 80\% in traditional education group, and to 78\% in game group; p {\textless} 0.001 for both) but remained significantly higher than at baseline in both groups (p {\textless} 0.001 for both). Although mean score was lower in game group than in traditional education  group at baseline (p = 0.04), no difference remained between groups either immediately or 3 months post-intervention. Score increment was better with the game (29\%) than with traditional education (21\%; p = 0.04). Beliefs improved in the game group only. CONCLUSIONS: InsuOnline(c) is at least as effective as a traditional educational activity for medical education on insulin therapy, and it can a good option for large-scale continuing medical education on diabetes.},

AIM: To compare (RPA) and Sedentary Lifestyle (SL) among children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and healthy peers. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Seven Italian paediatric  diabetes centres enrolled 129 children with T1D and 214 healthy peers who were interviewed by a telephone questionnaire on physical activity level, sedentary lifestyle and clinical data. RESULTS: Compared to healthy peers, children with T1D: performed the same amount of RPA, were more frequently engaged in team sports (p = 0.018), described RPA as an enjoyable activity (p = 0.033), not boring (p = 0.035), a chance to spend time with peers (p = 0.033) and to meet new friends (p = 0.016). Children with T1D were finally used to consume less snacks during watching TV (p {\textless} 0.001) or after physical activity (p {\textless} 0.001 ). HbA1c values were not related with time spent in physical activity, in watching TV or in playing video-games. CONCLUSIONS: Most interviewed children with T1D are physically active and perform the same amount of exercise as their healthy peers. They demonstrate to consider RPA a source of enjoyment and sociality and not a therapeutic imposition. (www.actabiomedica.it)},

This pilot study aimed to assess whether VG influences glycemic balance in children with type 1 diabetes. Twelve children with type 1 diabetes were subjected to two distinct tests at a few weeks interval: (i) a 60-min VG session followed by a 60-min rest period and  (ii) a 60-min reading session followed by a 60-min rest period. Heart rate, blood pressure, glycemia, epinephrine (E), norepinephrine (NE), cortisol (F), and growth hormone (GH) were measured at 30 min intervals from -60 to +120 min. Non-parametric Wilcoxon tests for paired data were performed on Delta-values computed from baseline (0 min). Rise in heart rate (p = 0.05) and NE increase (p  = 0.03) were shown to be significantly higher during the VG session when compared to the reading session and a significant difference of Delta-glycemic values was  measured between the respective rest periods. This pilot study suggests that VG playing could induce a state of excitation sufficient to activate the sympathetic system and alter the course of glycemia. Dietary and insulin dose recommendations may be needed to better control glycemic excursion in children playing VG.},

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of a mobile phone game ("MobileKids Monster Manor") as a tool to promote voluntary physical activity among children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The game integrates data from an accelerometer-based activity monitor (Tractivity((R)); Kineteks Corp., Vancouver, BC, Canada) wirelessly connected to a phone and was developed with the involvement of a team of young advisors (KidsCan Initiative: Involving Youth as Ambassadors for Research). Fifty-four children 8-13 years old  completed a week of baseline data collection by wearing an accelerometer but receiving no feedback about their activity levels. The 54 children were then sequentially assigned to two groups: One group played "MobileKids Monster Manor," and the other received daily activity feedback (steps and active minutes) via an  online program. The physical activity (baseline and intervention weeks) was measured using the activity monitor and compared using two-way repeated-measures  analysis of variance (interventionxtime). RESULTS: Forty-seven children with a body mass index (BMI) z-score of 0.35+/-1.18 successfully completed the study. Significant (P=0.01) increases in physical activity were observed during the intervention week in both the game and feedback groups (1191 and 796 steps/day, respectively). In the game group, greater physical activity was demonstrated in children with higher BMI z-score, showing 964 steps/day more per BMI z-score unit (P=0.03; 95 percent confidence interval of 98 to 1829).

To evaluate  the study, we conducted qualitative thematic analysis of semistructured interviews. RESULTS: Participants expressed frustrations with using the cell phones and the game system in their everyday lives, but liked the wireless system for collaborating with a provider on uploaded glucoses and receiving automatic feedback on their blood sugar trends. A majority of participants also expressed that their participation in the trial increased their health awareness. DISCUSSION: Mobile communication technologies showed promise within a web-based collaborative care program for type 2 diabetes. Future intervention design should focus on integrating easy-to-use applications within mobile technologies already  familiar to patients and ensure the system allows for sufficient collaboration with a care provider.},

OBJECTIVE: This study examined whether a 20-week exergame (i.e., videogame that requires gross motor activity) intervention can produce weight loss and improve psychosocial outcomes for 54 overweight and obese African-American adolescents. DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants were recruited from a public high school and randomly assigned to competitive exergame, cooperative exergame, or control conditions. All exergame participants were encouraged to play the Nintendo Wii Active game for 30-60 min per school day in a lunch-time or after-school program. Cooperative exergame participants worked with a peer to expend calories and earn  points together, whereas competitive exergame participants competed against a peer. Control participants continued regular daily activities. Outcome measures included changes in weight, peer support, self-efficacy, and self-esteem, measured at baseline, and at approximately 10 and 20 weeks. RESULTS: Growth curve analysis revealed that cooperative exergame players lost significantly more weight (mean = 1.65 kg; s.d. = 4.52) than the control group, which did not lose weight. The competitive exergame players did not differ significantly from the other conditions. Cooperative exergame players also significantly increased in self-efficacy compared to the control group, and both exergame conditions significantly increased in peer support more than the control group. CONCLUSION:  Exergames, especially played cooperatively, can be an effective technological tool for weight loss among youth.},

This article begins with a brief  overview of methods for producing and delivering VR environments that can be accessed by users for a range of clinical health conditions. Interactive digital  games and new forms of natural movement-based interface devices are also discussed in the context of the emerging area of exergaming, along with some of the early results from studies of energy expenditure during the use of these systems. While these results suggest that playing currently available active exergames uses significantly more energy than sedentary activities and is equivalent to a brisk walk, these activities do not reach the level of intensity  that would match playing the actual sport, nor do they deliver the recommended daily amount of exercise for children. However, these results provide some support for the use of digital exergames using the current state of technology as a complement to, rather than a replacement, for regular exercise. This may change in the future as new advances in novel full-body interaction systems for providing vigorous interaction with digital games are expected to drive the creation of engaging, low-cost interactive game-based applications designed to increase exercise participation in persons at risk for obesity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Smoking is recognized as the largest, single, preventable cause of death and disease in the developed world. While the majority of smokers report wanting to quit, and many try each year, smokers find it difficult to maintain long-term abstinence. Behavioral support, such as education, advice, goal-setting, and encouragement, is known to be beneficial in improving the likelihood of succeeding in a quit attempt, but it remains difficult to effectively deliver this behavioral support and keep the patient engaged with the process for a sufficient duration. In an attempt to solve this, there have been numerous mobile apps developed, yet engagement and retention have remained key challenges that limit the potential effectiveness of these interventions. Video games have been clearly linked with the effective delivery of health interventions, due to their capacity to increase motivation and engagement of players. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to describe the design and development of a smartphone app that is theory-driven, and which incorporates gaming characteristics in order to promote engagement with content, and thereby help smokers to quit. METHODS: Game design and development was informed by a taxonomy of motivational affordances for meaningful gamified and persuasive technologies. This taxonomy describes a set of design components that is grounded in well-established psychological theories on motivation. RESULTS: This paper reports on the design and development process of Quittr, a mobile app, describing how game design principles, game mechanics, and game elements can be used to embed education and support content, such that the app actually requires the user to access and engage with relevant educational content. The next stage of this research is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to determine whether the additional incentivization game features offer any value in terms of the key metrics of engagement-how much content users are consuming, how many days users are persisting with using the app, and what proportion of users successfully abstain from smoking for 28 days, based on user-reported data and verified against a biochemical baseline using cotinine tests. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a novel, and theoretically-informed mobile app design approach that has a broad range of potential applications. By using the virtual currency approach, we remove the need for the game to comprehensively integrate the healthy activity as part of its actual play mechanics. This opens up the potential for a wide variety of health problems to be tackled through games where no obvious play mechanic presents itself. The implications of this app are that similar approaches may be  of benefit in areas such as managing chronic conditions (diabetes, heart disease, etc), treating substance abuse (alcohol, illicit drugs, etc), diet and exercise,  eating disorders (anorexia, bulimia, and binge eating), and various phobias.},

	abstract = {The number of alpine accidents involving older trekkers has increased markedly in developed countries in recent years. More than 76.8\% of the trekkers involved in  alpine accidents in Japan were older than 40 years, with some experiencing a stroke or myocardial infarction while trekking at altitude. In the present study, we surveyed social trends in trekkers by interview at a popular mountain site, Mt Tanigawa (1963 m in altitude). The total number of trekkers interviewed was 511,  and more than 60\% of these were older than 40 years. Of trekkers older than 60 years, 42\% complained of conditions such as hypertension or diabetes. In 2 volunteer groups (10 younger subjects and 10 older subjects), physical condition  was assessed before and after trekking. Significant body weight loss induced by dehydration was observed more often in older subjects than in younger subjects (P {\textless} .05). Balance, as measured using the Nintendo WiiFit (Nintendo, Kyoto, Japan),  worsened in the older group (P {\textless} .05). Local police records for 2009 showed that  the total number of alpine accidents was 65. Injuries provoked by stumbling, slipping, and falling accounted for 51\% of these, and 82\% of casualties were older than 40 years, with 35\% being older than 60 years. In conclusion, many older people involved in nonchallenging middle-altitude trekking have problems with regard to overall health and balance. Alpine accidents caused by myocardial  infarction, stroke, or hypoglycemia tend to be more common in this population. Alpine rescue teams should be well prepared for this, and older trekkers should be made aware of their increased risk of injury in alpine settings.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to define the concept of an educational diabetes game following a user-centered design approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The concept development of the Eindhoven Diabetes Education Simulator (E-DES) project can be divided in two phases: concept generation and concept evaluation.  Four concepts were designed by the multidisciplinary development team based on the outcomes of user interviews. Four other concepts resulted from the Diabetes Game Jam. Several users and experts evaluated the concepts. These user evaluations and a feasibility analysis served as input for an overall evaluation  and discussion by the development team resulting in the final concept choice. RESULTS: The four concepts of the development team are a digital board game, a quiz platform, a lifestyle simulator, and a puzzle game. The Diabetes Game Jam resulted in another digital board game, two mobile swipe games, and a fairy tale-themed adventure game. The combined user evaluations and feasibility analysis ranked the quiz platform and the digital board game equally high. Each of these games fits one specific subgroup of users best: the quiz platform best fits an eager-to-learn, more individualistic patient, whereas the board game best fits a less-eager-to-learn, family-oriented patient. The choice for a specific concept is therefore highly dependent on the choice of our specific target audience. CONCLUSIONS: The user-centered design approach with multiple evaluations has enabled us to choose the most promising concept from eight different options. A digital board game is chosen for further development because the target audience for E-DES is the less-motivated, family-oriented patients.},

This holds not only for chronic diseases like asthma and diabetes, but also for the field of child psychotherapy. At the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry of Zurich University, the video game Treasure Hunt was developed to support psychotherapeutic treatment of children between eight and thirteen years  of age. Treasure Hunt does not replace the therapist but supports treatment by offering attractive electronic work assignments. The scope of this article is an  overview on health games for children and a description of Treasure Hunt. After the explanation of its therapeutic potentials, an evaluation based on questionnaires for therapists and children will be presented. 124 therapists answered a questionnaire on their impression of the game three months after download. 41 therapists were willing to participate in the further evaluation and sent questionnaires of 200 children with whom Treasure Hunt had been used. A limitation of these data is that a positive bias can not be excluded, as therapists with a positive attitude towards psychotherapeutic computer games were more likely to answer the questionnaire. 118 therapists (95.2\%) considered Treasure Hunt a useful tool in child psychotherapy. 197 children (98.5\%) report being satisfied with the use of the game during treatment. Treasure Hunt was predominantly used for the age group it is designed for and both, by very experienced and by young therapists.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sedentary behavior has been associated with deleterious cardiometabolic health indicators in adults, but very little research has examined this relationship in youth. PURPOSE: To examine the association between  the duration and type of sedentary screen behavior with diabetes risk factors (fasting glucose, insulin, homeostasis model-insulin resistance [HOMA-IR], 2-hour postload glucose, hemoglobin A1c) in a sample of overweight and obese adolescents. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 307 overweight or obese adolescents aged 14-18 years (90 boys, 217 girls) assessed at baseline of a lifestyle intervention for weight control conducted from 2005 to 2010. Sedentary  screen behaviors, defined as hours per day spent watching TV, playing seated video games, recreational computer use, and total screen time were measured by self-report. Data were analyzed using linear regression analyses in 2012. RESULTS: TV viewing was the only type of sedentary screen behavior associated with elevated diabetes risk factors before and after adjustment for confounders.  Specifically, TV viewing remained positively associated with fasting insulin (adjusted r=0.11, beta=0.10, p=0.048) and HOMA-IR (adjusted r=0.11, beta=0.10, p=0.05) after adjustment for age, gender, waist-to-hip ratio, caloric intake, percentage of intake in carbohydrates, physical activity duration, and physical activity intensity. CONCLUSIONS: TV watching may be independently associated with an increase in diabetes risk factors in a high-risk sample of overweight and obese adolescents. These findings provide support for interventions designed to reduce time spent watching TV as a possible means to attenuating diabetes risk factors in this high-risk population.},

While doctors and caregivers stress the importance of physical exercise in maintaining a healthy lifestyle, many people have difficulty subscribing to a healthy lifestyle. Virtual reality games offer a potentially exciting aid in accelerating and sustaining behavior change. However, care needs  to be taken to develop sustainable models of employing games for the management of diabetes and obesity. In this article, we propose an integrative gaming paradigm designed to combine multiple activities involving physical exercises and cognitive skills through a game-based storyline. The persuasive story acts as a motivational binder that enables a user to perform multiple activities such as running, cycling, and problem solving. These activities guide a virtual character through different stages of the game. While performing the activities in the games, users wear sensors that can measure movement (accelerometers, gyrometers,  magnetometers) and sense physiological measures (heart rate, pulse oximeter oxygen saturation). These measures drive the game and are stored and analyzed on  a cloud computing platform. A prototype integrative gaming system is described and design considerations are discussed. The system is highly configurable and allows researchers to build games for the system with ease and drive the games with different types of activities. The capabilities of the system allow for engaging and motivating the user in the long term. Clinicians can employ the system to collect clinically relevant data in a seamless manner.},

Computer-based educational approaches have a great deal of potential for patients use, and may offer a means of training more health-care professionals to deliver such improved care. In this article the potential role of IT in diabetes education is reviewed, focusing in particular on the application of compartmental models in both computer-based interactive simulators and educational video games. Close attention is devoted to practical applications-available today-for use by patients, their relatives, students and health-care professionals. The novel features and potential benefits of such methodologies are highlighted and some of the limitations of currently available software are discussed. The need for improved graphical user interfaces, and for further efforts to evaluate such programs and demonstrate an  educational benefit from their use are identified as hurdles to their more widespread application. The review concludes with a look to the future and the type of modelling features which should be provided in the next generation of interactive diabetes simulators and educational video games.},

The personal robot asked them about their names, sports and favourite colours, referred to these data during the interaction, and engaged in small talk. Fun, motivation and diabetes knowledge was measured. Child-robot interaction was observed. RESULTS: Children said the robot and quiz were fun, but this appreciation declined over time. With the personal robot, the children looked more at the robot and spoke more. The children mimicked the robot. Finally, an increase in knowledge about diabetes was observed. CONCLUSION: The study provides strong indication for how a personal robot can help children to improve health literacy in an enjoyable way. Children mimic the robot. When the robot is personal, they follow suit. Our results are positive and establish a good foundation for further development and testing in a larger study. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Using a robot in health care could contribute to self-management in children and help them to cope with their illness.},

Due to widespread use of technology among  teens in general, the use of serious games, games used for purposes beyond entertainment with the intention to educate and support health behavior for teens with diabetes self-management, is an emerging and promising practice. This report explores games intended for teens with diabetes, how the use of games may enhance clinical practice, and provides suggestions for future research and better utilization of these technologies. Current research on the use of gaming for promoting diabetes management in teens is fairly limited, with some initial support for improvements in both behavioral and clinical outcomes among teens. More research is clearly needed in order to further determine how gaming can best be utilized to impact health outcomes in these teens, as well as potential mechanisms of change.},

	abstract = {Digital games are an important class of eHealth interventions in diabetes, made possible by the Internet and a good range of affordable mobile devices (eg, mobile phones and tablets) available to consumers these days. Gamifying disease management can help children, adolescents, and adults with diabetes to better cope with their lifelong condition. Gamification and social in-game components are used to motivate players/patients and positively change their behavior and lifestyle. In this paper, we start by presenting the main challenges facing people with diabetes-children/adolescents and adults-from a clinical perspective, followed by three short illustrative examples of mobile and desktop game apps and platforms designed by Ayogo Health, Inc. (Vancouver, BC, Canada) for type 1 diabetes (one example) and type 2 diabetes (two examples). The games target different age groups with different needs-children with type 1 diabetes versus adults with type 2 diabetes. The paper is not meant to be an exhaustive review of all digital game offerings available for people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes,  but rather to serve as a taster of a few of the game genres on offer today for both types of diabetes, with a brief discussion of (1) some of the underpinning psychological mechanisms of gamified digital interventions and platforms as self-management adherence tools, and more, in diabetes, and (2) some of the hypothesized potential benefits that might be gained from their routine use by people with diabetes. More research evidence from full-scale evaluation studies is needed and expected in the near future that will quantify, qualify, and establish the evidence base concerning this gamification potential, such as what  works in each age group/patient type, what does not, and under which settings and criteria.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors searched the databases PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Sciences, and PsychINFO for articles published between January 1990 and January 2014. Reference lists were hand-searched to retrieve additional studies. Randomized controlled trials that compared a digital game with either standard education or no specific education in a population of children and/or adolescents with chronic conditions were included. RESULTS: The authors identified 9 studies in which the effectiveness of serious games in young people with chronic conditions was evaluated using a randomized controlled trials design. Six studies found a significant improvement of knowledge in the game group from pretest to posttest; 4 studies showed significantly better knowledge in the game group than in the control group after the intervention. Two studies reported significantly better self-management in the game group than in the control group after the intervention. Seven studies were included in the meta-analysis. For knowledge, pooled estimate of Hedges' gu was 0.361 (95\% confidence intervals, 0.098-0.624), demonstrating that serious games improve knowledge in patients. For self-management, pooled estimate of Hedges' gu was 0.310 (95\% confidence intervals, 0.122-0.497), showing that gaming improves self-management behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' meta-analysis shows that educational video games can be effective in improving knowledge and self-management in young people with chronic conditions.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This quasi-experimental exploratory study investigated neuropsychological effects of exercise among older adults with diabetes mellitus  (DM) compared with adults without diabetes (non-DM), and it examined the feasibility of using a stationary bike exergame as a form of exercise for older adults with and without diabetes. It is a secondary analysis that uses a small dataset from a larger randomized clinical trial (RCT) called the Cybercycle Study, which compared cognitive and physiological effects of traditional stationary cycling versus cybercycling. METHODS: In the RCT and the secondary analysis, older adults living in eight independent living retirement facilities in the state of New York were enrolled in the study and assigned to exercise five times per week for 45 min per session (two times per week was considered acceptable for retention in the study) by using a stationary bicycle over the course of 3 months. They were randomly assigned to use either a standard stationary bicycle or a "cybercycle" with a video screen that displayed virtual terrains, virtual tours, and racing games with virtual competitors. For this secondary analysis, participants in the RCT who had type 2 DM (n = 10) were compared with age-matched non-DM exercisers (n = 10). The relationship between exercise and executive function (i.e., Color Trials 2, Digit Span Backwards, and  Stroop C tests) was examined for DM and non-DM patients. RESULTS: Older adults with and without diabetes were able to use cybercycles successfully and complete  the study, so the feasibility of this form of exercise for this population was supported. However, in contrast with the larger RCT, this small subset did not demonstrate statistically significant differences in executive function between the participants who used cybercycles and those who used stationary bikes with no games or virtual content on a video screen. Therefore, the study combined the two groups and called them "exercisers" and compared cognitive outcomes for DM versus non-DM patients. As predicted, exercisers with DM exhibited significant gains in  executive function as measured by the Color Trails 2 test, controlling for age and education, while non-DM exercisers did not significantly gain in this measure [group x time interaction, F(1,16]) = 9.75; p = .007]. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results support the growing literature that finds that exercise may improve cognition among older adult with DM. Additional research is needed to clarify why certain aspects of executive function might be differentially affected. The current findings may encourage physicians to prescribe exercise for diabetes management and may help motivate DM patients' compliance for engaging in physical activity.},

Children are getting fatter because of increased caloric  intake and less physical activity. Furthermore, technology advances have failed to significantly improve metabolic control of type 1 diabetes. Behavioral strategies should target video games, mobile phones, and other popular items used by children and seen by them as necessities. Exergaming is considerably more active than traditional video gaming and can be equivalent to moderate-intensity  exercise. Diabetes equipment such as continuous glucose monitors and insulin pumps lack integration and live connectivity and suffer from a poor user interface. In contrast, mobile phones offer wireless connectivity, an excellent voice-enabled interface, and cloud connectivity that could possibly serve as a motivational and compliance tool for diabetes patients through text messaging to  the patient, parents, and physician. Mobile phones have the potential to motivate and educate obese children as well. Exergaming for obese children could also be integrated into award systems of game consoles and game play time. The key to successful implementation of these strategies depends on the ability to integrate and connect the various technologies.},

In the game, players take the role of animated characters who manage their diabetes by monitoring blood glucose, taking insulin injections, and choosing foods, while setting out to save a diabetes summer camp from marauding rats and mice who have stolen the diabetes supplies. Study participants were patients aged 8 to 16 from two separate diabetes clinics. Each participant received a Super Nintendo video game system at an initial clinic visit and was randomly assigned to receive either Packy \& Marlon (treatment group, N = 31) or an entertainment video game containing no diabetes-related content (control group, N = 28). Participants were interviewed and a parent filled out a questionnaire at baseline, three months, and six months. The findings in this study indicate that well-designed, educational video games can be effective interventions. There was improvement in the treatment group relative to the control group in terms of diabetes-related self-efficacy (p = 0.07), communication with parents about diabetes (p = 0.025), and self-care behaviours (p = 0.003), and a decrease in unscheduled urgent doctor visits (p = 0.08). There were no significant differences between the groups in knowledge about diabetes or in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels.

During an in-clinic visit, duplicate blood samples were tested by subjects (N = 147; aged 5-24 yr) and health care providers (HCPs) to evaluate the accuracy and precision of the Didget(R) system. Subjects'  meter results were compared against Yellow Springs Instruments (YSI) reference results and HCP results using least squares regression and error grid analyses. Precision was measured by average within-subject and within-HCP coefficient of variation (CV). During the home-use component of this study, subjects (n = 58) tested their blood glucose at least two to three times daily for 3-5 d to evaluate routine use of the system. Subjects' meter results showed significant correlations with both YSI (r(2) = 0.94; p {\textless} 0.001 for regression slope) and HCP  results (r(2) = 0.96; p {\textless} 0.001). Average within-subject and within-HCP CVs were  5.9 and 7.2\%, respectively. Overall satisfaction was assessed by subjects, their  parents or guardians, and HCP surveys. Subject satisfaction with the Didget(R) system was good to excellent; most subjects found the system easy to use, motivating, and helpful for building good blood glucose monitoring habits. Most HCPs agreed that the system fulfilled a need in diabetes management. In conclusion, the Didget(R) system was precise and clinically accurate in the hands of children, adolescents, and young adults with type 1 diabetes.},

INTERVENTIONS: At baseline, all participants underwent an all-out cardiopulmonary exercise test on a treadmill to assess peak  and average oxygen consumption (V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak and V[Combining Dot  Above]O2mean). Forty-eight to 72 hours after the cardiopulmonary exercise test, the same parameters were assessed during three 10-minute bouts of Wii Fit Plus exergaming and converted to percentage of treadmill V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak  (\%V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak and V[Combining Dot Above]O2mean during Wii Fit Plus play relative to V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak achieved during the cardiopulmonary exercise test. RESULTS: All Wii Fit Plus exercises generated a V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak of around 60\% and V[Combining Dot Above]O2mean of around 40\% of the  V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak as established during the cardiopulmonary exercise test. Mean heart rate and resting energy expenditure (respiratory exchange ratio) lay in a range of moderate aerobic exercise. A moderate-to-strong correlation between treadmill V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak and both exergame V[Combining Dot  Above]O2peak and exergame V[Combining Dot Above]O2mean was found. CONCLUSIONS: Video gaming has the potential to offer training intensities that concur with established guidelines for type 2 diabetic patients.

We briefly explored the use and impact of well-established learning theories in such games. The most frequently mentioned theoretical frameworks were social cognitive theory and social constructivism. Due to the limitations of the reported evaluation methodologies, little evidence was found to support the strong promise of games for diabetes. Furthermore, we could not establish a relation between design features and the game outcomes. We argue that an in-depth discussion about the extent to which learning theories could and should be manifested in the design decisions is required.},

The aim of study was to determine whether a virtual reality exercise (VRE)  program would improve balance, strength, gait, and falls efficacy in elderly adults with diabetes. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fifty-five subjects with diabetes mellitus over 65 years of age were randomly assigned to a VRE group (VREG) (n=27) and a control group (CG) (n=28). The VREG received the VRE program and diabetes education, whereas the CG received only the diabetes education. The VRE program used video gaming (PlayStation((R)) 2; Sony, Tokyo, Japan) and was conducted for  50 min twice a week for 10 weeks. Balance, muscle strength, gait, and falls efficacy were measured at baseline and after intervention. Measurements were taken using a clinical tests (the one-leg-standing test, the Berg Balance Scale,  the functional reach test, the timed up-and-go test, and the sit-to-stand test),  and gait analysis. A self-administered questionnaire was used to measure falls efficacy. RESULTS: After training, the VREG showed significantly improved balance, decreased sit-to-stand times, and increased gait speed, cadence, and falls efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: The VRE program was to maximize the effects of exercise by triggering players was to be fully immersed into the games and enhanced major influential factors on the falls of subject. This study suggests VRE programs are feasible and effective for reduced the risk of falls in elderly  adults with type 2 diabetes.},

METHODS: Studies were systematically identified for inclusion from Medline, Web of Science, CINAHL, EMBASE, Psychinfo, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library. Features of each video game intervention were reviewed and coded based on an existing taxonomy of diabetes interventions framework. RESULTS: Nine studies featuring 11 video games  for diabetes care were identified. Video games for diabetes have typically targeted children with type 1 diabetes mellitus and used situation problem-solving methods to teach diet, exercise, self-monitored blood glucose, and medication adherence. Evaluations have shown positive outcomes in knowledge,  disease management adherence, and clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Video games for diabetes education show potential as effective educational interventions. Yet we  found that improvements are needed in expanding the target audience, tailoring the intervention, and using theoretical frameworks. In the future, the reach and  effectiveness of educational video games for diabetes education could be improved by expanding the target audience beyond juvenile type 1 diabetes mellitus, the use of tailoring, and increased use of theoretical frameworks.},

	abstract = {Obesity is a central health issue due to its epidemic prevalence and its association with type 2 diabetes and other comorbidities. Obesity is not just being overweight. It is a metabolic disorder due to the accumulation of excess dietary calories into visceral fat and the release of high concentrations of free fatty acids into various organs. It represents a state of chronic oxidative stress and low-grade inflammation whose intermediary molecules may include leptin, adiponectin and cytokines. It may progress to hyperglycemia, leading to type 2 diabetes. Whether or not dietary antioxidant supplements are useful in the management of obesity and type 2 diabetes is discussed in this review. Only the benefits for obesity and diabetes are examined here. Other health benefits of antioxidants are not considered. There are difficulties in comparing studies in this field because they differ in the time frame, participants' ethnicity, administration of antioxidant supplements, and even in how obesity was measured.  However, the literature presents reasonable evidence for marginal benefits of supplementation with zinc, lipoic acid, carnitine, cinnamon, green tea, and possibly vitamin C plus E, although the evidence is much weaker for omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, coenzyme Q10, green coffee, resveratrol, or lycopene. Overall, antioxidant supplements are not a panacea to compensate for a  fast-food and video-game way of living, but antioxidant-rich foods are recommended as part of the lifestyle. Such antioxidant foods are commonly available.},

More evidence on self-management is needed to increase its implementation and improve metabolic outcomes.
METHODS: Data from 1316 participants with type 1 diabetes mellitus who were enrolled from Middle East countries into the International Diabetes Management Practices Study (IDMPS), a multinational observational survey, were analyzed to assess the impact of education on disease management and outcomes.
RESULTS: A majority (78\%) of participants failed to achieve glycemic target (HbA1c {\textless} 7.0\% [{\textless}53 mmol/mol]). Participants who had received diabetes education (59\%) were more likely to practice self-management than those who had not (odds ratio [OR]: 2.51; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.7-3.69; p {\textless} 0.001), and those who practiced self-management were more likely to attain target HbA1c than those who did not (OR: 1.49; 95\% CI: 1.06-2.09; p = 0.023).
CONCLUSIONS: These relationships between diabetes education, self-management and glycemic control suggest that diabetes education provides knowledge and skills to optimize self-management, favoring HbA1c target attainment. Middle East health authorities should search for ways to facilitate access to diabetes education to optimize treatment outcomes.},

So, patients must be educated to manage their diabetes. This study aims to assess the effect of education by telephone and short message service on empowering patients with type 2 diabetes (primary outcome).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted in the Urmia diabetes association in Iran. Sixty six participants with definitive diagnosis of type 2 diabetes entered into the study. Patients with secondary health problems were excluded. Patients were selected by simple random sampling then allocated into intervention (n=33) and control (n=33) groups. The intervention group received an educational text message daily and instructive phone calls three days a week for three months along with usual care. The Diabetes Empowerment Scale (DES) with confirmed validity and reliability was used for collecting data. Data was analyzed using SPSS V6.1. Independent t-test, paired t-test and chi-square were used to analyze the data.
RESULTS: The empowerment of the intervention group compared with the control group significantly improved after three months of distance education (p{\textless}0.00, EF=1. 16).
CONCLUSIONS: The study findings show that the distance education has a significant effect on empowering patients with type 2 diabetes. Therefore, using distance education along with other diabetes management intervention is highly effective and should be part of the care in diabetes treatment.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Saudi Arabia ranks second as the highest country with the highest prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) in the Middle East and seventh in the world. Knowledge, attitude, and good practice for foot care are essential in the management and prevention of diabetic foot ulcers.
Objective: This study was conducted to determine the knowledge, attitude, and practice to diabetic foot care among patients attending a diabetic clinic in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
Materials and Methods: We conducted a descriptive cross-sectional study of all the patients with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes aged ≥15 years seen at a diabetic clinic of King Saud Medical City in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A structured questionnaire on knowledge, attitude, and practices was used to collect the data.
Results: In total, 368 diabetic patients were surveyed, comprising 111 (30.2\%) males and 257 (69.8\%) females. About 282 (76.6\%) patients had good knowledge of diabetic foot and foot ulcers. Only 41 (11.1) patients have attended a class on diabetic foot care, and 81 (22.0\%) received education on diabetic foot care from a doctor and 38 (10.3\%) from a nurse. Majority of them washed their feet daily (98.4\%), 59.8\% inspects shoes before wearing them, but less than half of the patients (47.6\%) actually self-inspect their foot daily. Being married, having a secondary and university level of education, and being a government employee had significantly better knowledge of diabetic foot compared with their counterparts. There were no significant differences in the attitude toward diabetic foot and diabetic foot care across age groups. Patients with longer duration of diabetes ({\textgreater}5 years) significantly had better practice of diabetic foot care.
Conclusion: This study revealed a high percentage of the surveyed population with good knowledge and good practice of diabetic foot care, however with a poor attitude toward foot care. There were very few patients who received formal education on diabetic foot and diabetic foot care. There is a need for awareness program for these patients not only to improve their knowledge and practices, but also to motivate patients to have a positive attitude toward diabetic foot care.},

Poor engagement of patients and caregivers was a contributing factor in many fall incidents. Patients often fell as a result of not understanding or accepting their physical limitations. For better fall risk management, many incidents highlighted a need for providing complete and thorough care, better coordination of care, higher levels of sociocultural awareness, patient engagement, and caregiver involvement. The results provide evidence regarding the challenges and opportunities for improving fall risk management in home care along with insight about how information technology solutions can support improvement initiatives.

	abstract = {This study aimed at assessing the level of patients' satisfaction with primary heath care services after implementation of the electronic medical record system (EMR). Also, to explore the relationship of some participants' characteristics with satisfaction which are of importance in planning, managing and evaluation. A descriptive cross-sectional approach was adopted. Ten primary health care centers (out of total 78) related to the five health regions in Kuwait were randomly selected. A random sample of 200 people (at age of 18 years and above) attending the two-shift periods of the chosen centers were included. Through an exit interview, a well trained investigator interviewed them about their satisfaction with the primary heath care services provided after implementation of electronic medical record system. A structured questionnaire for measuring satisfaction was used. The response rate was 93.02\% of whom 47.5\% were males and 52.5\% were females. The mean overall satisfaction percent score as reported by subjects was 85.6\% (SD 4.9). There were statistically significant associations between mean percent satisfaction score of the participants and their age, level of education visiting the center at morning shift, and waiting less than 10 minutes before the examination. The vast majority of participants indicated that overall service at the center had greatly improved after EMR implementation. The system also helped in improvement of the physician performance, arrangement of patient's turn, dispense medication from pharmacy, written guidance of medication, accuracy and easiness of follow up for health status, time spent to retrieve medical record and that for receiving medication. However, it didn't achieve much improvement in physician selection or waiting time. The majority of interviewees (96.5\%) were totally satisfied with the overall quality of service at the center, location of the center (96.5\%), hours when the center is open (96.5\%), thoroughness of examination and accuracy of diagnosis (97.0\%), advices to avoid illness (96.0\%) and outcome of medical care (97.0\%). However, the lowest items of satisfaction were those related to explanation of medical procedures and tests (46.5\%) and ease of seeing physician of choice (61.0\%). Almost 62.0\% of the interviewed persons expressed their satisfaction with overall PHC service provided after EMR implementation. The leading two items of dissatisfaction that showed by the majority of dissatisfied participants were non-compliance of physician with good practice in prescription writing (75.0\%) and inability to see the same physician in every visit (72.4\%). The results showed that although the overall satisfaction was relatively high, certain aspects of the service showed some degree of dissatisfaction. This study demonstrated patient acceptance and support for the electronic medical record system at the primary care setting. These findings should encourage physicians to promote the use of electronic medical record system.},

report that CPOE reduces medication errors up to 81\%. Few researchers, however,
have focused on the existence or types of medication errors facilitated by
CPOE.Objective To identify and quantify the role of CPOE in facilitating prescription
error risks.Design, Setting, and Participants We performed a qualitative and quantitative study of house staff interaction
with a CPOE system at a tertiary-care teaching hospital (2002-2004). We surveyed
house staff (N = 261; 88\% of CPOE users); conducted 5 focus groups
and 32 intensive one-on-one interviews with house staff, information technology
leaders, pharmacy leaders, attending physicians, and nurses; shadowed house
staff and nurses; and observed them using CPOE. Participants included house
staff, nurses, and hospital leaders.Main Outcome Measure Examples of medication errors caused or exacerbated by the CPOE system.Results We found that a widely used CPOE system facilitated 22 types of medication
error risks. Examples include fragmented CPOE displays that prevent a coherent
view of patients’ medications, pharmacy inventory displays mistaken
for dosage guidelines, ignored antibiotic renewal notices placed on paper
charts rather than in the CPOE system, separation of functions that facilitate
double dosing and incompatible orders, and inflexible ordering formats generating
wrong orders. Three quarters of the house staff reported observing each of
these error risks, indicating that they occur weekly or more often. Use of
multiple qualitative and survey methods identified and quantified error risks
not previously considered, offering many opportunities for error reduction.Conclusions In this study, we found that a leading CPOE system often facilitated
medication error risks, with many reported to occur frequently. As CPOE systems
are implemented, clinicians and hospitals must attend to errors that these
systems cause in addition to errors that they prevent.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Implementations of health information technologies are notoriously difficult, which is due to a range of inter-related technical, social and organizational factors that need to be considered. In the light of an apparent lack of empirically based integrated accounts surrounding these issues, this interpretative review aims to provide an overview and extract potentially generalizable findings across settings.
Methods
We conducted a systematic search and critique of the empirical literature published between 1997 and 2010. In doing so, we searched a range of medical databases to identify review papers that related to the implementation and adoption of eHealth applications in organizational settings. We qualitatively synthesized this literature extracting data relating to technologies, contexts, stakeholders, and their inter-relationships.
Results
From a total body of 121 systematic reviews, we identified 13 systematic reviews encompassing organizational issues surrounding health information technology implementations. By and large, the evidence indicates that there are a range of technical, social and organizational considerations that need to be deliberated when attempting to ensure that technological innovations are useful for both individuals and organizational processes. However, these dimensions are inter-related, requiring a careful balancing act of strategic implementation decisions in order to ensure that unintended consequences resulting from technology introduction do not pose a threat to patients.
Conclusions
Organizational issues surrounding technology implementations in healthcare settings are crucially important, but have as yet not received adequate research attention. This may in part be due to the subjective nature of factors, but also due to a lack of coordinated efforts toward more theoretically-informed work. Our findings may be used as the basis for the development of best practice guidelines in this area.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to explore dietary supplements (DS) consumption patterns, sources of information about DS, and the impact of social media on DS knowledge among college students at Kuwait University. A cross-sectional self-administrated voluntary paper-based survey was distributed randomly to college students across all university campuses in December 2015. The questions focused on students� DS use and their attitudes towards the Internet and social media platforms (SMP) as a source of information about DS. Overall, 432 students across all Kuwait University campuses completed the survey (response rate 84\% � mean age 20.9 \&\#177;2.9). Results show that DS use among college students is high with only 24\% females and 26\% males stating to have never used DS. Differences between males and females exist when it comes to type of supplements they perceive to be beneficial, reasons for use, and sources of information. Similar percentage of males and females use the Internet as a source of information on dietary supplements. However, males appear to use non-health oriented sources, such as friends and gym coach, as primary source of DS information while females appear to prefer primary physicians and dietitians as a source. SMPs appear to serve as a significant source of information about dietary supplements. DS use among college age students is prevalent and the Internet and SMPs appear to serve as an important medium for information. Future studies should evaluate the usefulness of using SMPs by official health organizations to disseminate health and nutritional information.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to support home health agencies (HHAs) in the United States (US) in their individualized quality assessment and performance improvement (QAPI) initiatives by identifying their key performance improvement domains (KPIDs).
METHODS: Qualitative research was conducted by following the Framework method. Rich contextual data were obtained through focus group meetings participated by domain experts. The analysis results were further refined in an online forum and validated at a final meeting.
RESULTS: Four focus groups involving a total of 20 participants resulted in useful discussions during which various perspectives were expressed by the expert participants. A well-defined set of 17 KPIDs emerged under four categories, namely, economical value, sociocultural sensitivity, interpersonal relationships, and clinical capabilities.
CONCLUSIONS: The feedback we received from the focus groups indicates that performance improvement in HHAs is a lot more complicated than simply assessing whether certain clinical tasks are performed. The KPIDs identified in this study can help HHAs in their focused and individualized QAPI initiatives. Therefore, the results should be immediately relevant, interesting, and useful to the home care industry and policy makers in the US.},

The current qualitative study uncovers the challenges and opportunities of home health agencies (HHAs) in achieving better fall risk management. A secondary document analysis was adopted to learn from rich contextual information in fall incident reports recorded in a HHA. Poor engagement of patients and caregivers was a contributing factor in many fall incidents. Patients often fell as a result of not understanding or accepting their physical limitations. For better fall risk management, many incidents highlighted a need for providing complete and thorough care, better coordination of care, higher levels of sociocultural awareness, patient engagement, and caregiver involvement. The results provide evidence regarding the challenges and opportunities for improving fall risk management in home care along with insight about how information technology solutions can support improvement initiatives.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To help manage the risk of falls in home care, this study aimed to (i) identify home care clinicians' information needs and how they manage missing or inaccurate data, (ii) identify problems that impact effectiveness and efficiency associated with retaining, exchanging, or processing information about fall risks in existing workflows and currently adopted health information technology (IT) solutions, and (iii) offer informatics-based recommendations to improve fall risk management interventions.
METHODS: A case study was carried out in a single not-for-profit suburban Medicare-certified home health agency with three branches. Qualitative data were collected over a six month period through observations, semi-structured interviews, and focus groups. The Framework method was used for analysis. Maximum variation sampling was adopted to recruit a diverse sample of clinicians.
RESULTS: Overall, the information needs for fall risk management were categorized into physiological, care delivery, educational, social, environmental, and administrative domains. Examples include a brief fall-related patient history, weight-bearing status, medications that affect balance, availability of caregivers at home, and the influence of patients' cultures on fall management interventions. The unavailability and inaccuracy of critical information related to fall risks can delay necessary therapeutic services aimed at reducing patients' risk for falling and thereby jeopardizing their safety. Currently adopted IT solutions did not adequately accommodate data related to fall risk management.
CONCLUSION: The results highlight the essential information for fall risk management in home care. Home care workflows and health IT solutions must effectively and efficiently retain, exchange, and process information necessary for fall risk management. Interoperability and integration of the various health IT solutions to make data sharing accessible to all clinicians is critical for fall risk management. Findings from this study can help home health agencies better understand their information needs to manage fall risks.},

METHODS: Twelve in-depth semistructured interviews with the patients and caregivers were conducted within a descriptive single case study design in 1 home health agency (HHA) in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States.
RESULTS: Patients and caregivers faced challenges to manage fall risks such as unmanaged expectations, deteriorating cognitive abilities, and poor care coordination between the HHA and physician practices. Opportunities to leverage health IT solutions included patient portals, telehealth, and medication reminder apps on smartphones.
CONCLUSION: Effectively leveraging health IT could further empower patients and caregivers to reduce fall risks by acquiring the necessary information and following clinical advice and recommendations. The HHAs could improve the quality of care by adopting IT solutions that show more promise of improving the experiences of patients and caregivers in fall-risk management.},

The current qualitative study uncovers the challenges and opportunities of home health agencies (HHAs) in achieving better fall risk management. A secondary document analysis was adopted to learn from rich contextual information in fall incident reports recorded in a HHA. Poor engagement of patients and caregivers was a contributing factor in many fall incidents. Patients often fell as a result of not understanding or accepting their physical limitations. For better fall risk management, many incidents highlighted a need for providing complete and thorough care, better coordination of care, higher levels of sociocultural awareness, patient engagement, and caregiver involvement. The results provide evidence regarding the challenges and opportunities for improving fall risk management in home care along with insight about how information technology solutions can support improvement initiatives.

	abstract = {Background Smoking is recognized as the largest, single, preventable cause of death and disease in the developed world. While the majority of smokers report wanting to quit, and many try each year, smokers find it difficult to maintain long-term abstinence. Behavioral support, such as education, advice, goal-setting, and encouragement, is known to be beneficial in improving the likelihood of succeeding in a quit attempt, but it remains difficult to effectively deliver this behavioral support and keep the patient engaged with the process for a sufficient duration. In an attempt to solve this, there have been numerous mobile apps developed, yet engagement and retention have remained key challenges that limit the potential effectiveness of these interventions. Video games have been clearly linked with the effective delivery of health interventions, due to their capacity to increase motivation and engagement of players. Objective The objective of this study is to describe the design and development of a smartphone app that is theory-driven, and which incorporates gaming characteristics in order to promote engagement with content, and thereby help smokers to quit. Methods Game design and development was informed by a taxonomy of motivational affordances for meaningful gamified and persuasive technologies. This taxonomy describes a set of design components that is grounded in well-established psychological theories on motivation. Results This paper reports on the design and development process of Quittr, a mobile app, describing how game design principles, game mechanics, and game elements can be used to embed education and support content, such that the app actually requires the user to access and engage with relevant educational content. The next stage of this research is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to determine whether the additional incentivization game features offer any value in terms of the key metrics of engagement–how much content users are consuming, how many days users are persisting with using the app, and what proportion of users successfully abstain from smoking for 28 days, based on user-reported data and verified against a biochemical baseline using cotinine tests. Conclusions We describe a novel, and theoretically-informed mobile app design approach that has a broad range of potential applications. By using the virtual currency approach, we remove the need for the game to comprehensively integrate the healthy activity as part of its actual play mechanics. This opens up the potential for a wide variety of health problems to be tackled through games where no obvious play mechanic presents itself. The implications of this app are that similar approaches may be of benefit in areas such as managing chronic conditions (diabetes, heart disease, etc), treating substance abuse (alcohol, illicit drugs, etc), diet and exercise, eating disorders (anorexia, bulimia, and binge eating), and various phobias.},

Gamifying disease management can help children, adolescents, and adults with diabetes to better cope with their lifelong condition. Gamification and social in-game components are used to motivate players/patients and positively change their behavior and lifestyle. In this paper, we start by presenting the main challenges facing people with diabetes—children/adolescents and adults—from a clinical perspective, followed by three short illustrative examples of mobile and desktop game apps and platforms designed by Ayogo Health, Inc. (Vancouver, BC, Canada) for type 1 diabetes (one example) and type 2 diabetes (two examples). The games target different age groups with different needs—children with type 1 diabetes versus adults with type 2 diabetes. The paper is not meant to be an exhaustive review of all digital game offerings available for people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, but rather to serve as a taster of a few of the game genres on offer today for both types of diabetes, with a brief discussion of (1) some of the underpinning psychological mechanisms of gamified digital interventions and platforms as self-management adherence tools, and more, in diabetes, and (2) some of the hypothesized potential benefits that might be gained from their routine use by people with diabetes. More research evidence from full-scale evaluation studies is needed and expected in the near future that will quantify, qualify, and establish the evidence base concerning this gamification potential, such as what works in each age group/patient type, what does not, and under which settings and criteria.},

	abstract = {The majority of patients with overweight and type 2 diabetes show insufficient levels of daily physical activity (PA) and usually are among the least likely to engage in or adhere to any form of generic PA. Active video games (exergames) may be a solution to motivate these individuals to overcome their sedentary lifestyle. This systematic review was conducted to review the current evidence for the effectiveness of exergaming in overweight and type 2 diabetes mellitus and thus to evaluate the suitability of these games to be used as tools for exercise promotion that meet current PA guidelines. We searched electronic bibliographic databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, OpenGrey, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) up to March 2015. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) and cross-sectional studies published in English in a peer-reviewed journal and analyzing the effects of exergames on objectively measured intensity parameters of PA in overweight (body mass index [BMI] ≥25 kg/m(2)) adults (mean age ≥18 years) with and without type 2 diabetes were included. Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment were performed independently by two review authors. Primary outcomes included changes in oxygen uptake (VO2), energy expenditure (EE), heart rate (HR), or activity counts. Secondary outcomes were enjoyment of treatment, exercise adherence, ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), changes in body composition, and changes in blood parameters (serum glucose, long-term blood glucose, blood cholesterol, triglycerides, or serum lactate). Of 2845 records, 14 publications (11 studies) met the inclusion criteria. All included studies (ten experimental, cross-sectional laboratory studies and one RCT) were able to show increases in either VO2, EE, HR, or activity counts. However, effects of exergaming in terms of changes in these intensity parameters varied significantly between game modes and consoles as well as because of the vastly differing durations of exergame activity between studies. One of the included studies had a low risk of bias, and three had a high risk of bias; seven studies had an unclear risk of bias as the study description was insufficient. No studies were found investigating the changes in objectively measured PA intensity parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes. This review suggests that exergames are able to increase PA among overweight individuals. However, the inconsistent results and the overall poor or moderate methodological quality do not permit judgment on whether exergames are suitable to meet PA guidelines in this target group. The lack of research regarding the effects of exergames in type 2 diabetes indicates a great need for future research.},

	abstract = {Background: Physicians' lack of knowledge contributes to underuse of insulin and poor glycemic control in adults with diabetes mellitus (DM). Traditional continuing medical education have limited efficacy, and new approaches are required. Objective: We report the design of a trial to assess the educational efficacy of InsuOnline, a game for education of primary care physicians (PCPs). The goal of InsuOnline was to improve appropriate initiation and adjustment of insulin for the treatment of DM. InsuOnline was designed to be educationally adequate, self-motivating, and attractive. Methods: A multidisciplinary team of endocrinologists, experts in medical education, and programmers, was assembled for the design and development of InsuOnline. Currently, we are conducting usability and playability tests, with PCPs and medical students playing the game on a desktop computer. Adjustments will be made based on these results. An unblinded randomized controlled trial with PCPs who work in the city of Londrina, Brazil, will be conducted to assess the educational validity of InsuOnline on the Web. In this trial, 64 PCPs will play InsuOnline, and 64 PCPs will undergo traditional instructional activities (lecture and group discussion). Knowledge on how to initiate and adjust insulin will be assessed by a Web-based multiple choice questionnaire, and attitudes regarding diabetes/insulin will be assessed by Diabetes Attitude Scale 3 at 3 time points -- before, immediately after, and 6 months after the intervention. Subjects' general impressions on the interventions will be assessed by a questionnaire. Software logs will be reviewed. Results: To our knowledge, this is the first research with the aim of assessing the educational efficacy of a computer game for teaching PCPs about insulin therapy in DM. We describe the development criteria used for creating InsuOnline. Evaluation of the game using a randomized controlled trial design will be done in future studies. Conclusions: We demonstrated that the design and development of a game for PCPs education on insulin is possible with a multidisciplinary team. InsuOnline can be an attractive option for large-scale continuous medical education to help improving PCPs' knowledge on insulin therapy and potentially improving DM patients' care.

	abstract = {Therapeutic education in diabetes helps patients take responsibility for self-control of their disease, and providing technological support systems facilitates this education. In this paper, we present an augmented reality game to support therapeutic education for patients with diabetes. Our game helps children (aged 5-14 years) to learn carbohydrate (carb) content of different foods. The game shows virtual foods on a real dish. The number of carb choices corresponding to the visualized food is also shown (1 carb choice = 10 grams of carbs). A study to determine the effectiveness of the game in terms of learning and perceived satisfaction and usability was carried out. A total of seventy children with diabetes participated in the study. From the results, we observed that the initial knowledge about carb choices of the children who participated in the study was low (a mean of 2 on a scale from 0 to 9). This indicates that therapeutic education for patients with diabetes is needed. When the results for the pre-knowledge questionnaire and the post-knowledge questionnaire were compared, it was shown that the children learned about carb choices by playing our game. We used two post-knowledge questionnaires (one post-knowledge questionnaire that contained the same foods as the pre-knowledge questionnaire and a second post-knowledge questionnaire that contained foods that were different from the ones on the pre-knowledge questionnaire). There were no statistically significant differences between these two different post-knowledge questionnaires. Moreover, the knowledge acquired was independent of gender and age. We also evaluated usability and perceived satisfaction. The children were satisfied with the game and considered that the game offers a high degree of usability. This game could be a valuable therapeutic education tool for patients with diabetes.},

However, many active games are exercise themed, which may interfere with the distracting properties that make game-based exercise more enjoyable than traditional exercise. This study compared exercise-themed and game-themed active games to investigate differences in energy expenditure and enjoyment. Method: Young adults ( N = 100, 50 female, 55 overweight, aged 18–35 years) played two of four Wii Fit games (one aerobic game and one balance game per person) for 10 min each. Of the two aerobic games, one was exercise themed (jogging) and the other was game themed (hula hooping). Both balance games were game themed. Energy expenditure and enjoyment were measured. Results: After adjustment for gender and weight, aerobic games produced 2.70 kcal/kg −1 /h −1 (95\% confidence interval 2.41, 3.00) greater energy expenditure than balance games ( p {\textless} .001), but balance games were more enjoyable ( p {\textless} .001). In aerobic games, jogging produced greater energy expenditure than hula hooping in normal-weight and male participants ( p {\textless} .001); in overweight and female participants, no differences were found ( p {\textgreater} .17). Hula hooping was enjoyed more than jogging ( p = .008). Enjoyment predicted energy expenditure in aerobic games ( B = 0.767, p = .010). Conclusions: Aerobic games produced greater energy expenditure but lower enjoyment than balance games, and a game-themed aerobic game was found more enjoyable than an exercise-themed aerobic game. Integrating more strenuous activity into entertaining games instead of games that simply simulate exercise may be a fruitful avenue for active game development.},

Children are getting fatter because of increased caloric intake and less physical activity. Furthermore, technology advances have failed to significantly improve metabolic control of type 1 diabetes. Behavioral strategies should target video games, mobile phones, and other popular items used by children and seen by them as necessities. Exergaming is considerably more active than traditional video gaming and can be equivalent to moderate-intensity exercise. Diabetes equipment such as continuous glucose monitors and insulin pumps lack integration and live connectivity and suffer from a poor user interface. In contrast, mobile phones offer wireless connectivity, an excellent voice-enabled interface, and cloud connectivity that could possibly serve as a motivational and compliance tool for diabetes patients through text messaging to the patient, parents, and physician. Mobile phones have the potential to motivate and educate obese children as well. Exergaming for obese children could also be integrated into award systems of game consoles and game play time.

A population sample of 4,512 (1,945 men) Scottish Health Survey 2003 respondents (≥35 years) were followed up to 2007 for all-cause mortality and CVD events (fatal and nonfatal combined). Main exposures were interviewer-assessed screen time ({\textless}2 h/day; 2 to {\textless}4 h/day; and ≥4 h/day) and moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity. Two hundred fifteen CVD events and 325 any-cause deaths occurred during 19,364 follow-up person-years. The covariable (age, sex, ethnicity, obesity, smoking, social class, long-standing illness, marital status, diabetes, hypertension)-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality was 1.52 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06 to 2.16) and for CVD events was 2.30 (95\% CI: 1.33 to 3.96) for participants engaging in ≥4 h/day of screen time relative to {\textless}2 h/day. Adjusting for physical activity attenuated these associations only slightly (all-cause mortality: HR: 1.48, 95\% CI: 1.04 to 2.13; CVD events: HR: 2.25, 95\% CI: 1.30 to 3.89). Exclusion of participants with CVD events in the first 2 years of follow-up and previous cancer registrations did not change these results appreciably. Approximately 25\% of the association between screen time and CVD events was explained collectively by C-reactive protein, body mass index, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Recreational sitting, as reflected by television/screen viewing time, is related to raised mortality and CVD risk regardless of physical activity participation. Inflammatory and metabolic risk factors partly explain this relationship.},

	abstract = {This quasi-experimental exploratory study investigated neuropsychological effects of exercise among older adults with diabetes mellitus (DM) compared with adults without diabetes (non-DM), and it examined the feasibility of using a stationary bike exergame as a form of exercise for older adults with and without diabetes. It is a secondary analysis that uses a small dataset from a larger randomized clinical trial (RCT) called the Cybercycle Study, which compared cognitive and physiological effects of traditional stationary cycling versus cybercycling. In the RCT and the secondary analysis, older adults living in eight independent living retirement facilities in the state of New York were enrolled in the study and assigned to exercise five times per week for 45 min per session (two times per week was considered acceptable for retention in the study) by using a stationary bicycle over the course of 3 months. They were randomly assigned to use either a standard stationary bicycle or a "cybercycle" with a video screen that displayed virtual terrains, virtual tours, and racing games with virtual competitors. For this secondary analysis, participants in the RCT who had type 2 DM (n = 10) were compared with age-matched non-DM exercisers (n = 10). The relationship between exercise and executive function (i.e., Color Trials 2, Digit Span Backwards, and Stroop C tests) was examined for DM and non-DM patients. Older adults with and without diabetes were able to use cybercycles successfully and complete the study, so the feasibility of this form of exercise for this population was supported. However, in contrast with the larger RCT, this small subset did not demonstrate statistically significant differences in executive function between the participants who used cybercycles and those who used stationary bikes with no games or virtual content on a video screen. Therefore, the study combined the two groups and called them "exercisers" and compared cognitive outcomes for DM versus non-DM patients. As predicted, exercisers with DM exhibited significant gains in executive function as measured by the Color Trails 2 test, controlling for age and education, while non-DM exercisers did not significantly gain in this measure [group × time interaction, F(1,16]) = 9.75; p = .007]. These preliminary results support the growing literature that finds that exercise may improve cognition among older adult with DM. Additional research is needed to clarify why certain aspects of executive function might be differentially affected. The current findings may encourage physicians to prescribe exercise for diabetes management and may help motivate DM patients' compliance for engaging in physical activity.},

While doctors and caregivers stress the importance of physical exercise in maintaining a healthy lifestyle, many people have difficulty subscribing to a healthy lifestyle. Virtual reality games offer a potentially exciting aid in accelerating and sustaining behavior change. However, care needs to be taken to develop sustainable models of employing games for the management of diabetes and obesity. In this article, we propose an integrative gaming paradigm designed to combine multiple activities involving physical exercises and cognitive skills through a game-based storyline. The persuasive story acts as a motivational binder that enables a user to perform multiple activities such as running, cycling, and problem solving. These activities guide a virtual character through different stages of the game. While performing the activities in the games, users wear sensors that can measure movement (accelerometers, gyrometers, magnetometers) and sense physiological measures (heart rate, pulse oximeter oxygen saturation). These measures drive the game and are stored and analyzed on a cloud computing platform. A prototype integrative gaming system is described and design considerations are discussed. The system is highly configurable and allows researchers to build games for the system with ease and drive the games with different types of activities. The capabilities of the system allow for engaging and motivating the user in the long term. Clinicians can employ the system to collect clinically relevant data in a seamless manner.},

The countries that make up the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) are no exception but transitions in population ageing are still in the early stages of the process. With current demographic dividends experienced by the GCC and the rest of the Middle-East, the pace of population ageing will be faster than that experienced by many European countries. The purpose of this paper is to explore the population ageing experience of different GCC countries while situating this within a context of social policies that still at the very early stages of acknowledging such change. We utilise data from sources such as the United Nations and the World Bank, complemented by policy analysis of current age-related social security measures in the GCC. Given the importance of the family aged care system in the region, we consider the implications of changes in family structures, living conditions, and care needs for the elderly. The findings confirm the declining trend in fertility combined with increased life expectancy in all the six GCC countries. However, they highlight that social policy measures focused on the older generations and their care needs are still relatively at the early stages of each country's policy agenda. The implications of such changes are serious in term of both the demand for and supply of care. Policy-makers need to adapt cohesive social policy strategies that strengthen the complementing relationships between the state, family and wider community as stakeholders in the provision of aged care.},

A prescription of exercise designed to meet a patient's individual needs with minimal supervision from healthcare practitioners would facilitate this. However, the optimal prescription of exercise in the population remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: This review examines the effects planned self-directed exercise has on glycosylated haemoglobin and other outcomes in individuals with T2DM and aims to  identify the most suitable forms of planned self-directed exercise for individuals with T2DM that can be carried out independently. METHODS: A search of the electronic databases PubMed, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane (Trials) and ClinicalTrials.gov was conducted along with reference lists of previous reviews. Randomised controlled trials published in English between January 1990 and February 2015 examining participants diagnosed with T2DM only were included.  Studies were critically appraised using the PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database) scale and data were presented on standardised tables. RESULTS: Twenty-eight articles that used five element gymnastics, a games console exercise intervention (Wii fit plus) or aerobic, resistance or combined training were included. CONCLUSION: This review comprehensively summarised the effects planned  self-directed exercise interventions had on individuals with T2DM. The review found that self-directed exercise was found to be beneficial for individuals with T2DM for improving glycosylated haemoglobin, physical characteristics, cardiorespiratory fitness, functional measures and other metabolic outcomes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exergaming is a novel approach to increase motivation for regular physical activity (PA) among sedentary individuals such as patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Because existing exergames do not offer fitness-level adjusted, individualized workouts and are normally stationary (TV bound), thus not enabling PA anywhere and at any time, we developed a smartphone-based, game-like software application (MOBIGAME) specifically designed for middle-aged T2DM patients to induce a healthier, more active lifestyle as part of successful  T2DM treatment and management. In a randomized controlled trial we aim to examine whether our smartphone-based game application can lead to increases in daily PA in T2DM patients that are persistent in the mid to long term and whether these increases are greater than those in a control group. METHODS: This study is designed as a randomized controlled trial. We plan to recruit a total of 42 T2DM  patients [45-70 years, body mass index (BMI) {\textgreater}/=25 kg/m2, low daily PA, regular smartphone use]. The experimental intervention (duration 24 weeks) includes individualized multidimensional home-based exercise and daily PA promotion administered through MOBIGAME. The control intervention consists of a one-time standard lifestyle counseling including the promotion of baseline activities. The primary outcome is daily PA measured as steps per day. Secondary outcome is exercise adherence measured via the usage data from the participants' smartphones (experimental intervention) and as self-recorded exercise log entries (control intervention). We will test the hypothesis that there will be differences between the experimental and control group with respect to post-interventional daily PA (as well as all other outcomes) using analysis of covariance. For each analysis,  an estimate (with 95\% confidence interval) of the difference in outcome between both groups will be reported. DISCUSSION: This research will investigate the effectiveness of a novel smartphone-based, game-like software application to be used as a way to promote regular daily PA among inactive T2DM patients. The results of this trial may have important implications for future PA-promoting interventions and provide relevant information for the general transferability of such applications to be used as part of the treatment in other chronic diseases.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Local ischemia and mechanical trauma to hollow abdominal organs are quoted as a cause of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding during and after long distance running. There are no data on athletes from rugby and other contact sports where mechanical trauma of the abdomen is frequent. METHODS: Occult bleeding in the stool of Croatian national rugby team players has been investigated during and after qualification match with Italy for the World Cup 1999 on June 6th 1998 in Makarska, Croatia. One player with positive test was followed and examined in detail after the game. RESULTS: Among 11 Croatian players authors discovered one with a history of GI symptoms and one with conversion of negative to positive test for occult bleeding in stool after the match. The latter player had no GI symptoms or diseases, took no medications, played only 20 minutes in the match on forward position. Conversion has been found in the second stool sample after game (24 to 48 hours after game). The athlete was followed for 18 months. Persistent low values of hemoglobin, hematocrit and serum iron were revealed, as well as expressed hemorrhoids without signs of haemorrhage or inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Lower incidence of GI bleeding among rugby players than among long distance runners minimize the importance of mechanical abdominal trauma in the etiology of GI bleeding during sports activity. Hemorrhoids are not quoted as a cause of GI bleeding after sport activity among athletes.},

Children spent approximately 2 h per day watching television, playing games or using a computer. CONCLUSION: There is an urgent need for community-based approaches to address the high rates of obesity and related cardiovascular risk factors among these Aboriginal children. Given the disconnect between healthy living knowledge and behaviour, it is important that future treatment programs address other barriers faced by Aboriginal populations living  in rural and remote regions, including the high cost and limited access to high-quality nutritious foods and beverages, and limited access to indoor recreational programs over the long winter season.},

	abstract = {AIM: The needs of physical activity can be seen through the lack of numbers participating in regular physical activity as well as the increase in prevalence  of certain diseases such as Type II diabetes (especially in children), cardiovascular diseases, and some cancers. With the increase in preventable diseases that are caused in part by a sedentary lifestyle, a closer look needs to be taken into the role of family interaction as a means of increasing physical activity for both adults and children. Because of the many benefits of physical activity in relation to health, a family approach to achieving recommended levels of physical activity may be quite applicable. METHODS: Forty volunteers were recruited from the community (20 subjects and 20 children). The volunteers played 2 games: soccer and nerfball. Data was collected over 10 minutes (5 min per game). Expired air analysis was used to calculate energy expenditure and metabolic equivalents (METs). Descriptive statistics were calculated along with a regression analysis to determine differences between the 2 games, and an ACOVA to determine any significant effects of age, child age, gender, and physical activity level on the results. RESULTS: For both games, average heart rate measured approximately 88\%max; average METs measured approximately 6, average energy expenditure measured approximately 40 kcal. CONCLUSIONS: S: This study showed that adults can achieve recommended physical activity levels through these specific activities if sustained for approximately 20 min.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Soccer is the most popular sport worldwide, with a long history and currently more than 500 million active participants, of whom 300 million are registered football club members. On the basis of scientific findings showing positive fitness and health effects of recreational soccer, FIFA (Federation Internationale de Football Association) introduced the slogan "Playing football for 45 min twice a week-best prevention of non-communicable diseases" in 2010. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature to determine the effects of recreational soccer on maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max). METHODS: Six electronic databases (MEDLINE, PubMed, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, CINAHL and Google Scholar) were searched for original research articles. A manual search was performed to cover the areas of recreational soccer, recreational physical activity, recreational small-sided games and VO2max using the following key terms, either singly or in combination:  recreational small-sided games, recreational football, recreational soccer, street football, street soccer, effect, maximal oxygen uptake, peak oxygen uptake, cardiorespiratory fitness, VO2max. The inclusion criteria were divided into four sections: type of study, type of participants, type of interventions and type of outcome measures. Probabilistic magnitude-based inferences for meta-analysed effects were based on standardised thresholds for small, moderate and large changes (0.2, 0.6 and 1.2, respectively) derived from between-subject standard deviations for baseline fitness. RESULTS: Seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis.  Mean differences showed that VO2max increased by 3.51 mL/kg/min (95 \% CI 3.07-4.15) over a recreational soccer training programme in comparison with other training models. The meta-analysed effects of recreational soccer on VO2max compared with the controls of no exercise, continuous running and strength training were most likely largely beneficial [effect size (ES) = 1.46; 95 \% confidence interval (CI) 0.91, 2.01; I (2) = 88.35 \%], most likely moderately beneficial (ES = 0.68; 95 \% CI 0.06, 1.29; I (2) = 69.13 \%) and most likely moderately beneficial (ES = 1.08; 95 \% CI -0.25, 2.42; I (2) = 71.06 \%), respectively. In men and women, the meta-analysed effect was most likely largely  beneficial for men (ES = 1.22) and most likely moderately beneficial for women (ES = 0.96) compared with the controls. After 12 weeks of recreational soccer with an intensity of 78-84 \% maximal heart rate (HRmax), healthy untrained men improved their VO2max by 8-13 \%, while untrained elderly participants improved their VO2max by 15-18 \%. Soccer training for 12-70 weeks in healthy women resulted in an improvement in VO2max of 5-16 \%. Significant improvements in VO2max have been observed in patients with diabetes mellitus, hypertension and prostate cancer. CONCLUSION: Recreational soccer produces large improvements in VO2max compared to strength training and no exercise, regardless of the age, sex  and health status of the participants. Furthermore, recreational soccer is better than continuous endurance running, albeit the additional effect is moderate. This kind of physical activity has great potential for enhancing aerobic fitness, and  for preventing and treating non-communicable diseases, and is ideal for addressing lack of motivation, a key component in physical (in)activity.},

Caucasian youth (n 630) aged 8-10 years at recruitment,  with at least one obese biological parent, were studied (QUebec Adipose and Lifestyle InvesTigation in Youth cohort). IS was measured using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) of insulin resistance and Matsuda IS index. ISct was measured using HOMA2\%-beta, the ratio of the AUC of insulin:glucose over the first 30 min (AUC I/G(t= 30 min)) of the oral glucose tolerance test and AUC I/G(t= 120 min) over 2 h. Fitness was measured using VO(2)(peak), percentage of fat mass by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and 7 d MVPA using accelerometry; screen time (ST) by average daily hours of self-reported television, video game or computer use. Dietary composition was measured using three non-consecutive dietary recalls. Non-parametric smoothing splines were used to model non-linear associations; all models were adjusted for age, sex, season, pubertal stage, MVPA, fitness, ST and adiposity. The percentage of total daily energy from dietary protein, fat, saturated fat and carbohydrate and the consumption of dietary vitamin D, sugar-sweetened beverages, fibre and portions of fruits and vegetables were taken into consideration. No dietary component was associated with any measure of IS after adjusting for MVPA, fitness, ST and adiposity. For every 1\% increase in daily protein intake (\%), AUC I/G(t= 30 min) decreased by 1.1\% (P= 0.033). Otherwise, dietary composition was not associated with ISct. While long-term excess of energy intake has been shown to lead to overweight and  obesity, dietary macronutrient composition is not independently correlated with IS or ISct in youth.},

	abstract = {This supplement contains 16 original articles describing how football conducted as small sided games affects fitness and health of untrained individuals across the lifespan. The intermittent nature of football and high exercise intensity result in a broad range of effects. The heart changes its structure and improves  its function. Blood pressure is markedly reduced with the mean arterial blood pressure being lowered by {\textasciitilde}10 mmHg for hypertensive men and women training 2-3 times/week for 12-26 weeks. Triglycerides and cholesterol are lowered and body fat declines, especially in middle-aged men and women with type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, muscle mass and bone mineral density increases in a number of participant groups, including 65-75-year-old men. The functional capacity is elevated with increases in VO(2) max of 10-15\%, and 50-100\% improvements in the capacity to perform intermittent work within 16 weeks. These effects apply irrespective of whether the participants are young, overweight, elderly or suffering from a disease. The studies clearly show that the participants enjoy playing football and form special relationships with their team mates. Thus, football is a healthy activity, providing a unique opportunity to increase recruitment and adherence to physical activity in a hitherto underserved population, and to treat and rehabilitate patients with hypertension, type 2 diabetes and prostate cancer.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Despite extensive evidence showing that lifestyle habits play a critical role in preventing or delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes in adults, little is known regarding the impact of lifestyle habits on type 2 diabetes risk  in childhood. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether adiposity, fitness, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, and screen time predict insulin sensitivity or insulin secretion during a 2-year period in children with a family history of obesity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This is a prospective longitudinal cohort study of 630 children, having at least 1 obese parent, recruited from schools in Quebec, Canada, between July 2005 and December 2008 in  the Quebec Adipose and Lifestyle Investigation in Youth (QUALITY) cohort. Children were assessed at baseline (ages 8-10 years) and 2 years later. Fitness was measured by peak oxygen consumption, percentage of body fat (adiposity) by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity using accelerometry, and screen time by average daily hours of self-reported television, video game, or computer use. Regression models were adjusted for age, sex, season, and pubertal stage. The current analysis was completed in October 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Insulin sensitivity was measured by the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance and an oral glucose tolerance  test-based index (Matsuda insulin sensitivity index). Insulin secretion was measured using the area under the curve of insulin to glucose during the first 30 minutes of the oral glucose tolerance test and using the area under the curve of  insulin to glucose over 2 hours. RESULTS: Of 630 children evaluated at baseline (mean [SD] age, 9.6 [0.9] years; 54.4\% male; 56.2\% normal weight, 19.2\% overweight, and 22.7\% obese), 564 were evaluated at 2-year follow-up. Adiposity and changes in adiposity were the central predictors of insulin dynamics over time. Every additional 1\% of body fat at ages 8 to 10 years decreased insulin sensitivity by 2.9\% (95\% CI, -3.3\% to -2.5\%; P {\textless} .001) and led to a 0.5\% (95\% CI, 0.09\% to 0.8\%; P = .02) increased requirement in the area under the curve of insulin to glucose during the first 30 minutes of the oral glucose tolerance test 2 years later. Higher levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and lower  screen time appear to be beneficial to insulin sensitivity in part through their  effect on adiposity levels. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Adiposity plays a determining role in cardiometabolic health at a young age. Public health strategies that promote healthy body weight, notably physical activity, need to target school-aged and possibly younger children.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: While obesity is known to have many physiological consequences, the psychopathology of this condition has not featured prominently in the literature. Cross-sectional studies have indicated that obese children have increased odds of experiencing poor quality of life and mental health. However, very limited trial  evidence has examined the efficacy of exercise therapy for enhancing mental health outcomes in obese children, and the Sheffield Obesity Trial (SHOT) will provide evidence of the efficacy of supervised exercise therapy in obese young people aged 11-16 years versus usual care and an attention-control intervention.  METHOD/DESIGN: SHOT is a randomised controlled trial where obese young people are randomised to receive; (1) exercise therapy, (2) attention-control intervention (involving body-conditioning exercises and games that do not involve aerobic activity), or (3) usual care. The exercise therapy and attention-control sessions will take place three times per week for eight weeks and a six-week home programme will follow this. Ninety adolescents aged between 11-16 years referred  from a children's hospital for evaluation of obesity or via community advertisements will need to complete the study. Participants will be recruited according to the following criteria: (1) clinically obese and aged 11-16 years (Body Mass Index Centile {\textgreater} 98th UK standard) (2) no medical condition that would  restrict ability to be active three times per week for eight weeks and (3) not diagnosed with insulin dependent diabetes or receiving oral steroids. Assessments of outcomes will take place at baseline, as well as four (intervention midpoint)  and eight weeks (end of intervention) from baseline. Participants will be reassessed on outcome measures five and seven months from baseline. The primary endpoint is physical self-perceptions. Secondary outcomes include physical activity, self-perceptions, depression, affect, aerobic fitness and BMI.},

PARTICIPANTS: Twelve type 2 diabetic patients (10 male and 2 female; age, 60.2 +/- 7.7 years; body mass index, 30.9 +/- 6.2 kg/m). INTERVENTIONS: At baseline, all participants underwent an all-out cardiopulmonary exercise test on a treadmill to assess peak  and average oxygen consumption (V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak and V[Combining Dot  Above]O2mean). Forty-eight to 72 hours after the cardiopulmonary exercise test, the same parameters were assessed during three 10-minute bouts of Wii Fit Plus exergaming and converted to percentage of treadmill V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak  (\%V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak and V[Combining Dot Above]O2mean during Wii Fit Plus play relative to V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak achieved during the cardiopulmonary exercise test. RESULTS: All Wii Fit Plus exercises generated a V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak of around 60\% and V[Combining Dot Above]O2mean of around 40\% of the  V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak as established during the cardiopulmonary exercise test. Mean heart rate and resting energy expenditure (respiratory exchange ratio) lay in a range of moderate aerobic exercise. A moderate-to-strong correlation between treadmill V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak and both exergame V[Combining Dot  Above]O2peak and exergame V[Combining Dot Above]O2mean was found. CONCLUSIONS: Video gaming has the potential to offer training intensities that concur with established guidelines for type 2 diabetic patients. The training intensity is self-adjusting based on fitness level allowing for an effective workout for different users.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Rates of obesity, Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease are high among Pacific people in New Zealand. Physical activity is recommended in the prevention and management of these conditions. Community-based, 'small-sided game' group activities may be an effective and culturally appropriate way to promote physical activity within Pacific communities. AIM: To assess the effectiveness of small-sided games-based exercise on fitness and health parameters among Pacific adults over four weeks. METHODS: Twenty untrained (13 female) Pacific adults were randomised to intervention or control. Intervention participants were offered 45 minutes of small-sided games three times per week for four weeks. Control participants were offered one-month gym membership after  the trial. Primary outcomes included cardiorespiratory fitness (VO(2)peak) and leg strength (maximal concentric force of quadriceps at 60 degrees /second) measured at baseline and four weeks. Secondary outcomes included glycaemia, lipid profile, blood pressure (BP), and inflammatory markers. Multivariable regression  models were used to assess differences between groups, adjusting for baseline values, age and gender. RESULTS: At baseline, mean age was 34.8 years (SD 12.6),  BMI 36.3 (6.7), systolic BP 127.7 mmHg (12.1), HbA1c 6.1\% (1.9), VO(2)peak 2.5 L/min (0.6) and leg strength 170.0 N.m (57.4). Sixteen participants completed the trial. Change in outcomes were greater in intervention than control participants  in absolute VO(2)peak (0.9 L/min (p=0.003)), leg strength (17.8 N.m (p=0.04)) and HDL (0.12 mmol/L (p=0.02)). There were no other significant differences. DISCUSSION: Small-sided games appear to be a promising means for improving the health and cardiorespiratory fitness and reducing the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease in Pacific adults.},

DESIGN: Experimental cross-sectional study. SETTING: Controlled laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Twelve type 2 diabetic patients (10 male and 2 female; age, 60.2 +/- 7.7 years; body mass index, 30.9 +/- 6.2 kg/m). INTERVENTIONS: At baseline, all participants underwent an all-out cardiopulmonary exercise test on a treadmill to assess peak  and average oxygen consumption (V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak and V[Combining Dot  Above]O2mean). Forty-eight to 72 hours after the cardiopulmonary exercise test, the same parameters were assessed during three 10-minute bouts of Wii Fit Plus exergaming and converted to percentage of treadmill V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak  (\%V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak and V[Combining Dot Above]O2mean during Wii Fit Plus play relative to V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak achieved during the cardiopulmonary exercise test. RESULTS: All Wii Fit Plus exercises generated a V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak of around 60\% and V[Combining Dot Above]O2mean of around 40\% of the  V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak as established during the cardiopulmonary exercise test. Mean heart rate and resting energy expenditure (respiratory exchange ratio) lay in a range of moderate aerobic exercise. A moderate-to-strong correlation between treadmill V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak and both exergame V[Combining Dot  Above]O2peak and exergame V[Combining Dot Above]O2mean was found. CONCLUSIONS: Video gaming has the potential to offer training intensities that concur with established guidelines for type 2 diabetic patients. The training intensity is self-adjusting based on fitness level allowing for an effective workout for different users.},

There is growing evidence that repeated exercise-induced transient increases in neurotrophic factors can augment neurogenesis and neuroplasticity. This pilot study compares the effects of 30-min submaximal cycling with those of exergaming (combining exercise and video gaming) at the same duration and same rating of perceived exertion (BORG RPE: 14-15) on serum neurotrophic factors in 8 elderly non-insulin-dependent T2DM patients (71+/-4 years) (2x2 crossover design). Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF),  vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1  levels were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. Heart rates were almost equal during cycling and exergaming, while lactate values were significantly higher during cycling (cycling versus exergaming: 3.7+/-1.1 versus 2.5+/-1.2 mmol/l, p{\textless}0.05). BDNF and VEGF levels were increased significantly post-cycling (+20\%,+14\%, p{\textless}0.05). No other significant pre-post changes were evident. This study demonstrates that acute exercise can increase neurotrophic factors (BDNF, VEGF) in elderly T2DM patients, depending on exercise mode.},

RECENT FINDINGS: Structural and functional brain impairments are present in obese adolescents with metabolic syndrome (MetS). Aerobic training for 20 or 40 min per day produced similar affects on metabolic risk factors. Vitamin D supplementation has been shown to improve the metabolic risk factors in obese children; however, obese children require greater doses to treat vitamin D deficiency. A 10-week community-based exergaming weight management program significantly decreased the BMI in obese children. SUMMARY: There is surmounting research on MetS and its associated risk  factors in obese children. Gaining a comprehensive overview of the factors associated with obesity in children is crucial in developing the most effective intervention strategies. Community-based and family-centered interventions have generated positive results in reducing children's BMI and improving MetS risk factors. In addition to obesity intervention efforts, ongoing prevention initiatives are imperative to reduce the prevalence of childhood obesity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exergaming is a novel approach to increase motivation for regular physical activity (PA) among sedentary individuals such as patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Because existing exergames do not offer fitness-level adjusted, individualized workouts and are normally stationary (TV bound), thus not enabling PA anywhere and at any time, we developed a smartphone-based, game-like software application (MOBIGAME) specifically designed for middle-aged T2DM patients to induce a healthier, more active lifestyle as part of successful  T2DM treatment and management. In a randomized controlled trial we aim to examine whether our smartphone-based game application can lead to increases in daily PA in T2DM patients that are persistent in the mid to long term and whether these increases are greater than those in a control group. METHODS: This study is designed as a randomized controlled trial. We plan to recruit a total of 42 T2DM  patients [45-70 years, body mass index (BMI) {\textgreater}/=25 kg/m2, low daily PA, regular smartphone use]. The experimental intervention (duration 24 weeks) includes individualized multidimensional home-based exercise and daily PA promotion administered through MOBIGAME. The control intervention consists of a one-time standard lifestyle counseling including the promotion of baseline activities. The primary outcome is daily PA measured as steps per day. Secondary outcome is exercise adherence measured via the usage data from the participants' smartphones (experimental intervention) and as self-recorded exercise log entries (control intervention). We will test the hypothesis that there will be differences between the experimental and control group with respect to post-interventional daily PA (as well as all other outcomes) using analysis of covariance. For each analysis,  an estimate (with 95\% confidence interval) of the difference in outcome between both groups will be reported. DISCUSSION: This research will investigate the effectiveness of a novel smartphone-based, game-like software application to be used as a way to promote regular daily PA among inactive T2DM patients. The results of this trial may have important implications for future PA-promoting interventions and provide relevant information for the general transferability of such applications to be used as part of the treatment in other chronic diseases.

	abstract = {About one third of adolescents in the USA are overweight and/or obese. Obesity during the adolescent years is associated with many adverse health consequences,  including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and psychosocial problems. Because of substantial advances in technologies and wide acceptance by  adolescents, it is now possible to use technology for healthy weight management and prevention of obesity. This systematic review used Preferred Reporting Items  for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and aimed to evaluate the existing literature reported on the effectiveness of technology-based intervention (web-based, e-learning, and active video games) in preventing obesity in adolescents. The primary aim of this review was to explore if components of specific interventions were associated with a reduction in body mass index. Research articles obtained from CINAHL, Embase, PubMed, PsycInfo, and the Cochrane database from1990 to 2014 were reviewed. A total of 131 published articles were identified, and 14 met the inclusion criteria of a randomized or nonrandomized clinical study with body mass index as primary outcome and/or secondary outcomes of diet/physical activity and/or psychosocial function, tested lifestyle interventions to prevent obesity, used technology, and studied adolescents (aged 12-18 years). The results indicated that six of 14 studies found body mass index and/or body fat decreased at short-term (less than 12 months) follow-up. Six of eleven studies that examined physical activity or physical activity-related outcomes found an improved physical activity outcome (time playing active video games and increase in physical activity time), while five of seven studies which assessed dietary outcomes indicated improvement in dietary behaviors. Five of seven studies suggested an improvement in psychosocial function (reduced depression, improved self-esteem and efficacy, improvement on Behavior Assessment Scale) in adolescents involved in the technology-based intervention. All effective interventions utilized dietary and physical activity  strategies as part of intervention components. Because of the variation in duration of intervention (range 10 weeks to 2 years), it is not clear what length of intervention is most effective. Future research should assess the long-term impact of technology-based interventions and evaluate mediators and moderators for weight change in adolescents.},

Children are getting fatter because of increased caloric  intake and less physical activity. Furthermore, technology advances have failed to significantly improve metabolic control of type 1 diabetes. Behavioral strategies should target video games, mobile phones, and other popular items used by children and seen by them as necessities. Exergaming is considerably more active than traditional video gaming and can be equivalent to moderate-intensity  exercise. Diabetes equipment such as continuous glucose monitors and insulin pumps lack integration and live connectivity and suffer from a poor user interface. In contrast, mobile phones offer wireless connectivity, an excellent voice-enabled interface, and cloud connectivity that could possibly serve as a motivational and compliance tool for diabetes patients through text messaging to  the patient, parents, and physician. Mobile phones have the potential to motivate and educate obese children as well. Exergaming for obese children could also be integrated into award systems of game consoles and game play time. The key to successful implementation of these strategies depends on the ability to integrate and connect the various technologies.},

We aim to assess the impact of a new mobile exergame, MobileKids Monster Manor (MKMM), in a school-based setting. MKMM, developed with input from youth to enhance physical activity, is wirelessly connected to an accelerometer-based activity monitor. Forty-two healthy students (11.3 +/- 1.2 years old and 0.28 +/- 1.29 body-mass index [BMI] z-score) participated in a randomized 4-week crossover study to evaluate the game intervention. The two study arms consisted of week-long baseline, game intervention/control, washout, and control/game intervention phases. All participants were required to wear an activity monitor at all times to record steps and active minutes for the study duration. MKMM was used during each arm's respective intervention week, during which children were asked to play the game at their convenience. When children were exposed to the game, an increase compared with the control phase of 2,934 steps per day (p = 0.0004, 95\%  CI 1,434-4,434) and 46 active minutes per day (p = 0.001, 95\% CI 20-72) from baseline (12,299 steps/day and 190 active minutes/day) was observed. A linear regression model showed that MKMM yielded a greater increase in steps and active  minutes per day among children with a higher BMI z-score, showing 10 percent more steps per day and 14 percent more active minutes per day relative to baseline, per unit increase in BMI z-score. In conclusion, MKMM increased steps and active  minutes in a school-based environment. This suggests that mobile exergames could  be useful tools for schools to promote physical activity and combat obesity in adolescents.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity is associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes. A key obstacle to physical activity is lack of motivation. Although some interactive exercise games (i.e., exergames--video games that require physical exertion in order to play) motivate players to exercise more, few games take advantage of group dynamics to motivate players' duration of exercise. In a test  of the Kohler motivation gain effect, this study varied the ability level of a virtually presented partner in an interactive exergame that focused on abdominal  strength to identify effects on a subject's (S') persistence with the task. METHOD: Male (n = 63) and female (n = 72) undergraduate students were randomly assigned to one of four conditions (individual control or low-, moderate-, or high- partner discrepancy) in a conditions x gender factorial design and tested on a series of isometric abdominal exercises using PlayStation 2 EyeToy: Kinetic  software. They performed the first series of five exercises alone (trial block 1), and after a rest period, those in the partner conditions performed remaining  trials (trial block 2) with a same-sex virtually presented partner whom they could observe during their performance, while those in the individual control condition performed the remaining trials alone. In the partner conditions, the partner's performance was manipulated to be always better than the S's, the exact difference depending on the discrepancy condition. The partnered tasks were conjunctive; that is, success in the game depended on the performance of the weaker team member. Persistence, the outcome measure for this study, consisted of the total number of seconds the S held the exercise position. RESULTS: Using planned orthogonal contrasts on difference scores between blocks 1 and 2, results showed that persistence was significantly (p {\textless} .001) greater in all experimental  conditions with a virtually presented partner (M = 33.59 s) than in the individual control condition (M = -49.04 s). Subjects demonstrated more persistence in the moderate-discrepancy condition (M = 51.36 s) than in the low-discrepancy condition (M = 22.52 s) or the high-discrepancy condition (M = 26.89 s). A significant quadratic trend confirmed the expected inverted-U function relating partner discrepancy and persistence (p = .025). Although Ss persisted longer and had higher heart rate in partnered conditions, they did not  perceive their exertion to be any higher than those in the individual condition.  CONCLUSIONS: Virtually presented partners who are moderately more capable than participants are the most effective at improving persistence in exergame tasks.},

	abstract = {Childhood obesity is nowadays considered as one of the major health problems that many societies suffer from. The obesity epidemic leads to several life threatening conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, and  mental health problems like depression, anxiety and loneliness just to mention a  few. Several approaches, including physical exercises, strict dietary, and exergames among others, have been adopted to address the obesity epidemic. Exergames are considered the innovative approach for fighting several health problem such as the obesity, where a combination of exercise and 3D gaming are proposed to incite kids to exercise as a team. Collaborative exergaming became even more popular given that it addresses the social side of the obesity epidemic, and it motivates kids to socialize with other kids. Traditional exergames are based on the client server approach where the server is responsible for streaming the 3D environment. However, this can lead to latency and server bottleneck if many clients participate in the exergame, which leads to the kids stopping exercising. Having an exergame application that does not suffer from networking problem such as delay, is very important given that it increases the exercise hours. In this work, we propose a new trend of mobile collaborative exergming applications that is based on the peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture, as well as two supplying partner selection protocols that aim at selecting the suitable source responsible for streaming the relevant 3D data. Our system, that  we refer to as MOSAIC, is intended for mobile collaborative exergames that incite kids to move inside a large area, using thin mobile devices such as head mounted  devices (HMD), have physical exercises, and collaborate with other kids which in  consequence address several health problems such as the obesity epidemic on the physical and social plans. Our proposed mobile collaborative exergame aims at inciting the kids to exercise as a team for a longer time by improving the quality of the streaming and reducing the delay. This is accomplished by our proposed supplying partner selection protocols that provide a quick discovery of  multiple supplying partners, by minimizing the time required the to acquire data. The performance evaluation we have obtained to evaluate our suite of protocols using a realistic set of exergame scenarios for obese kids is then presented and  discussed.},

METHOD: Thirty-one low-income 15- to 19-year-old overweight and obese African American adolescents were randomly assigned to a competitive exergame (n = 17) or a cooperative exergame (n = 14) condition. Participants played a preassigned Wii Active exergame routine that took between 30 and 60 min  each school day, and sessions occurred during lunch time or an after-school program over a 6 month period. Participation was voluntary, so students decided whether to come or not on a given day. Cooperative exergame players worked together with a peer to expend calories and earn points, while competitive exergame players competed individually against a peer to expend calories and earn points. Motivation was measured through surveys and interviews at the end of the  intervention, and energy expenditure was measured by accelerometry during game play. RESULTS: Compared with the competitive group, the cooperative players were  significantly more intrinsically motivated to play (p = .034, partial eta-squared = 0.366) and more psychologically attracted to the design of the exergame (p = .034, partial eta-squared = 0.320). Intrinsic motivation was significantly positively correlated with energy expenditure during game play: individuals who were motivated by control/choice had higher energy expenditure (p = .026), and those who were more goal motivated (p = .004) and more immersed in game play (p = .024) had lower energy expenditure during game play. CONCLUSIONS: Cooperative exergame play produced higher intrinsic motivation to play the exergame than competitive exergame play did. Intrinsic motivation that came from a desire for control/choice was related to higher energy expenditure during game play. Cooperative exergame play holds promise as a method for engaging overweight and obese youth in physical activity.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This quasi-experimental exploratory study investigated neuropsychological effects of exercise among older adults with diabetes mellitus  (DM) compared with adults without diabetes (non-DM), and it examined the feasibility of using a stationary bike exergame as a form of exercise for older adults with and without diabetes. It is a secondary analysis that uses a small dataset from a larger randomized clinical trial (RCT) called the Cybercycle Study, which compared cognitive and physiological effects of traditional stationary cycling versus cybercycling. METHODS: In the RCT and the secondary analysis, older adults living in eight independent living retirement facilities in the state of New York were enrolled in the study and assigned to exercise five times per week for 45 min per session (two times per week was considered acceptable for retention in the study) by using a stationary bicycle over the course of 3 months. They were randomly assigned to use either a standard stationary bicycle or a "cybercycle" with a video screen that displayed virtual terrains, virtual tours, and racing games with virtual competitors. For this secondary analysis, participants in the RCT who had type 2 DM (n = 10) were compared with age-matched non-DM exercisers (n = 10). The relationship between exercise and executive function (i.e., Color Trials 2, Digit Span Backwards, and  Stroop C tests) was examined for DM and non-DM patients. RESULTS: Older adults with and without diabetes were able to use cybercycles successfully and complete  the study, so the feasibility of this form of exercise for this population was supported. However, in contrast with the larger RCT, this small subset did not demonstrate statistically significant differences in executive function between the participants who used cybercycles and those who used stationary bikes with no games or virtual content on a video screen. Therefore, the study combined the two groups and called them "exercisers" and compared cognitive outcomes for DM versus non-DM patients. As predicted, exercisers with DM exhibited significant gains in  executive function as measured by the Color Trails 2 test, controlling for age and education, while non-DM exercisers did not significantly gain in this measure [group x time interaction, F(1,16]) = 9.75; p = .007]. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results support the growing literature that finds that exercise may improve cognition among older adult with DM. Additional research is needed to clarify why certain aspects of executive function might be differentially affected. The current findings may encourage physicians to prescribe exercise for diabetes management and may help motivate DM patients' compliance for engaging in physical activity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The majority of patients with overweight and type 2 diabetes show insufficient levels of daily physical activity (PA) and usually are among the least likely to engage in or adhere to any form of generic PA. Active video games (exergames) may be a solution to motivate these individuals to overcome their sedentary lifestyle. OBJECTIVES: This systematic review was conducted to review the current evidence for the effectiveness of exergaming in overweight and type 2 diabetes mellitus and thus to evaluate the suitability of these games to be used  as tools for exercise promotion that meet current PA guidelines. METHODS: We searched electronic bibliographic databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, OpenGrey, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) up to March 2015. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) and cross-sectional studies published in English in a peer-reviewed journal and analyzing the effects of exergames on objectively measured intensity parameters of PA in overweight (body mass index [BMI] {\textgreater}/=25 kg/m(2)) adults (mean age {\textgreater}/=18 years) with and without type 2 diabetes were included. Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment  were performed independently by two review authors. Primary outcomes included changes in oxygen uptake (VO2), energy expenditure (EE), heart rate (HR), or activity counts. Secondary outcomes were enjoyment of treatment, exercise adherence, ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), changes in body composition, and  changes in blood parameters (serum glucose, long-term blood glucose, blood cholesterol, triglycerides, or serum lactate). RESULTS: Of 2845 records, 14 publications (11 studies) met the inclusion criteria. All included studies (ten experimental, cross-sectional laboratory studies and one RCT) were able to show increases in either VO2, EE, HR, or activity counts. However, effects of exergaming in terms of changes in these intensity parameters varied significantly between game modes and consoles as well as because of the vastly differing durations of exergame activity between studies. One of the included studies had a low risk of bias, and three had a high risk of bias; seven studies had an unclear risk of bias as the study description was insufficient. No studies were found investigating the changes in objectively measured PA intensity parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSION: This review suggests that exergames are able to increase PA among overweight individuals. However, the inconsistent results and the overall poor or moderate methodological quality do not permit judgment on whether exergames are suitable to meet PA guidelines in this target group. The lack of research regarding the effects of exergames in type 2 diabetes indicates a great need for future research.},

This article begins with a brief  overview of methods for producing and delivering VR environments that can be accessed by users for a range of clinical health conditions. Interactive digital  games and new forms of natural movement-based interface devices are also discussed in the context of the emerging area of exergaming, along with some of the early results from studies of energy expenditure during the use of these systems. While these results suggest that playing currently available active exergames uses significantly more energy than sedentary activities and is equivalent to a brisk walk, these activities do not reach the level of intensity  that would match playing the actual sport, nor do they deliver the recommended daily amount of exercise for children. However, these results provide some support for the use of digital exergames using the current state of technology as a complement to, rather than a replacement, for regular exercise. This may change in the future as new advances in novel full-body interaction systems for providing vigorous interaction with digital games are expected to drive the creation of engaging, low-cost interactive game-based applications designed to increase exercise participation in persons at risk for obesity.},

OBJECTIVE: This study examined whether a 20-week exergame (i.e., videogame that requires gross motor activity) intervention can produce weight loss and improve psychosocial outcomes for 54 overweight and obese African-American adolescents. DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants were recruited from a public high school and randomly assigned to competitive exergame, cooperative exergame, or control conditions. All exergame participants were encouraged to play the Nintendo Wii Active game for 30-60 min per school day in a lunch-time or after-school program. Cooperative exergame participants worked with a peer to expend calories and earn  points together, whereas competitive exergame participants competed against a peer. Control participants continued regular daily activities. Outcome measures included changes in weight, peer support, self-efficacy, and self-esteem, measured at baseline, and at approximately 10 and 20 weeks. RESULTS: Growth curve analysis revealed that cooperative exergame players lost significantly more weight (mean = 1.65 kg; s.d. = 4.52) than the control group, which did not lose weight. The competitive exergame players did not differ significantly from the other conditions. Cooperative exergame players also significantly increased in self-efficacy compared to the control group, and both exergame conditions significantly increased in peer support more than the control group.

Most of the systematic reviews were found to be medium quality on the AMSTAR checklist. Most commonly, systematic reviews and reviews evaluated active videogames. According to the results, evidence of the highest level and quality seems to support an increase in physical activity to light to moderate levels and energy expenditure, especially when playing active videogames that require both upper and lower body movements. In addition, sedentary games were shown to have potential in children's health education, especially in supporting changes in asthma- and diabetes-related behavior and in dietary habits.

	abstract = {Obesity is a central health issue due to its epidemic prevalence and its association with type 2 diabetes and other comorbidities. Obesity is not just being overweight. It is a metabolic disorder due to the accumulation of excess dietary calories into visceral fat and the release of high concentrations of free fatty acids into various organs. It represents a state of chronic oxidative stress and low-grade inflammation whose intermediary molecules may include leptin, adiponectin and cytokines. It may progress to hyperglycemia, leading to type 2 diabetes. Whether or not dietary antioxidant supplements are useful in the management of obesity and type 2 diabetes is discussed in this review. Only the benefits for obesity and diabetes are examined here. Other health benefits of antioxidants are not considered. There are difficulties in comparing studies in this field because they differ in the time frame, participants' ethnicity, administration of antioxidant supplements, and even in how obesity was measured.  However, the literature presents reasonable evidence for marginal benefits of supplementation with zinc, lipoic acid, carnitine, cinnamon, green tea, and possibly vitamin C plus E, although the evidence is much weaker for omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, coenzyme Q10, green coffee, resveratrol, or lycopene. Overall, antioxidant supplements are not a panacea to compensate for a  fast-food and video-game way of living, but antioxidant-rich foods are recommended as part of the lifestyle. Such antioxidant foods are commonly available.},

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Seven Italian paediatric  diabetes centres enrolled 129 children with T1D and 214 healthy peers who were interviewed by a telephone questionnaire on physical activity level, sedentary lifestyle and clinical data. RESULTS: Compared to healthy peers, children with T1D: performed the same amount of RPA, were more frequently engaged in team sports (p = 0.018), described RPA as an enjoyable activity (p = 0.033), not boring (p = 0.035), a chance to spend time with peers (p = 0.033) and to meet new friends (p = 0.016). Children with T1D were finally used to consume less snacks during watching TV (p {\textless} 0.001) or after physical activity (p {\textless} 0.001 ). HbA1c values were not related with time spent in physical activity, in watching TV or in playing video-games. CONCLUSIONS: Most interviewed children with T1D are physically active and perform the same amount of exercise as their healthy peers.

Whether the American story and characters in Diab might be perceived by Hong Kong Chinese children as  interesting has not been explored. This study assessed the acceptability and applicability of Diab among Hong Kong Chinese children, whether the Diab story was understood by them, and whether it had potential to influence them both during the game and afterward. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Thirty-four students (21 males, 13 females) 9-12 years of age were included. Upon completion of all the Diab episodes, children completed an immersion scale with 18 items, as well as an individual interview with 10 open-ended questions. RESULTS: Children achieved average immersion after playing Diab with the mean score at 39.1 (standard deviation = 9.0), higher than the median (36) of possible scores (range, 18-54).  Four themes using framework analysis emerged from the interviews, including intuitive feelings about the interface, playing experience, perception of the effect of Diab on behavior change, and the applicability of Diab to Hong Kong children. The story and game developed for American children were found acceptable and applicable to Hong Kong Chinese children. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of quantitative and qualitative methods confirmed the acceptability and applicability of Diab to Hong Kong Chinese children.},

They can generate an important state of excitation, representing a form of mental and physical stress. This pilot study aimed to assess whether VG influences glycemic balance in children with type 1 diabetes. Twelve children with type 1 diabetes were subjected to two distinct tests at a few weeks interval: (i) a 60-min VG session followed by a 60-min rest period and  (ii) a 60-min reading session followed by a 60-min rest period. Heart rate, blood pressure, glycemia, epinephrine (E), norepinephrine (NE), cortisol (F), and growth hormone (GH) were measured at 30 min intervals from -60 to +120 min. Non-parametric Wilcoxon tests for paired data were performed on Delta-values computed from baseline (0 min). Rise in heart rate (p = 0.05) and NE increase (p  = 0.03) were shown to be significantly higher during the VG session when compared to the reading session and a significant difference of Delta-glycemic values was  measured between the respective rest periods. This pilot study suggests that VG playing could induce a state of excitation sufficient to activate the sympathetic system and alter the course of glycemia. Dietary and insulin dose recommendations may be needed to better control glycemic excursion in children playing VG.},

The purpose of this review is to examine published research on the use of videogames for diabetes management. With the increased use of mobile technology, the review was expanded to understand whether games, gamification, and virtual environments can be used for diabetes self-management. Out of the 307 articles identified, only 10 articles met the inclusion criteria of the study. The duration of most studies was short, with small sample sizes. All interventions targeted behavioral changes examining risk  reduction of diabetes-related risk and promotion of healthy behavior among study  participants. Videogames appeared to be helpful tools for education in some interventions, whereas gamification and virtual environments increased extrinsic  motivation and provided positive reinforcement. This review concludes by discussing the potential of using videogames and gamification for the self-management of diabetes.},

There is growing evidence that repeated exercise-induced transient increases in neurotrophic factors can augment neurogenesis and neuroplasticity. This pilot study compares the effects of 30-min submaximal cycling with those of exergaming (combining exercise and video gaming) at the same duration and same rating of perceived exertion (BORG RPE: 14-15) on serum neurotrophic factors in 8 elderly non-insulin-dependent T2DM patients (71+/-4 years) (2x2 crossover design). Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF),  vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1  levels were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. Heart rates were almost equal during cycling and exergaming, while lactate values were significantly higher during cycling (cycling versus exergaming: 3.7+/-1.1 versus 2.5+/-1.2 mmol/l, p{\textless}0.05). BDNF and VEGF levels were increased significantly post-cycling (+20\%,+14\%, p{\textless}0.05). No other significant pre-post changes were evident. This study demonstrates that acute exercise can increase neurotrophic factors (BDNF, VEGF) in elderly T2DM patients, depending on exercise mode.},

	abstract = {PROBLEM: Priority health-risk behaviors contribute to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among youth and adults. Population-based data on these behaviors at the national, state, and local levels can help monitor the effectiveness of public health interventions designed to protect and promote the  health of youth nationwide. REPORTING PERIOD COVERED: September 2012-December 2013. DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM: The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) monitors six categories of priority health-risk behaviors among youth and young adults: 1) behaviors that contribute to unintentional injuries and violence; 2) tobacco use; 3) alcohol and other drug use; 4) sexual behaviors that contribute to unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; 5) unhealthy dietary behaviors; and 6) physical inactivity. In addition, YRBSS monitors the prevalence of obesity and asthma. YRBSS includes a national school-based Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) conducted by CDC and state and large urban school district school-based YRBSs conducted by state and local education and health agencies. This report summarizes results for 104 health-risk behaviors plus obesity, overweight, and asthma from the 2013 national survey, 42 state surveys, and 21 large urban school district surveys conducted among students in grades 9-12. RESULTS: Results from the 2013 national YRBS indicated that many high school students are engaged in priority health-risk behaviors associated with the leading causes of death among persons aged 10-24 years in the United States. During the 30 days before the survey, 41.4\% of high school students nationwide among the 64.7\% who drove a car or other vehicle during the 30 days before the survey had texted or e-mailed while driving, 34.9\% had drunk alcohol, and 23.4\% had used marijuana. During the 12 months before the survey, 14.8\% had been electronically bullied, 19.6\% had been bullied on school property, and 8.0\% had attempted suicide. Many high school students nationwide are engaged in sexual risk behaviors that contribute to unintended pregnancies and STIs, including HIV  infection. Nearly half (46.8\%) of students had ever had sexual intercourse, 34.0\% had had sexual intercourse during the 3 months before the survey (i.e., currently sexually active), and 15.0\% had had sexual intercourse with four or more persons  during their life. Among currently sexually active students, 59.1\% had used a condom during their last sexual intercourse. Results from the 2013 national YRBS  also indicate many high school students are engaged in behaviors associated with  chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. During the 30 days before the survey, 15.7\% of high school students had smoked cigarettes and 8.8\% had used smokeless tobacco. During the 7 days before the survey, 5.0\% of high school students had not eaten fruit or drunk 100\% fruit juices and 6.6\% had not eaten vegetables. More than one-third (41.3\%) had played  video or computer games or used a computer for something that was not school work for 3 or more hours per day on an average school day. INTERPRETATION: Many high school students engage in behaviors that place them at risk for the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. The prevalence of most health-risk behaviors varies by sex, race/ethnicity, and grade and across states and large urban school districts. Long term temporal changes also have occurred. Since the earliest year of data collection, the prevalence of most health-risk behaviors has decreased (e.g., physical fighting, current cigarette use, and current sexual activity), but the prevalence of other health-risk behaviors has not changed (e.g., suicide  attempts treated by a doctor or nurse, having ever used marijuana, and having drunk alcohol or used drugs before last sexual intercourse) or has increased (e.g., having not gone to school because of safety concern and obesity and overweight). PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: YRBSS data are used widely to compare the prevalence of health-risk behaviors among subpopulations of students; assess trends in health-risk behaviors over time; monitor progress toward achieving 20 national health objectives for Healthy People 2020 and one of the 26 leading health indicators; provide comparable state and large urban school district data; and help develop and evaluate school and community policies, programs, and practices designed to decrease health-risk behaviors and improve health outcomes  among youth.},

RESULTS: Results from the 2015 national YRBS indicated that many high school students are engaged in priority health-risk behaviors associated with the leading causes of death among persons aged 10-24 years in the United States.

More than one third (41.7\%)  had played video or computer games or used a computer for something that was not  school work for 3 or more hours per day on an average school day and 14.3\% had not participated in at least 60 minutes of any kind of physical activity that increased their heart rate and made them breathe hard on at least 1 day during the 7 days before the survey. Further, 13.9\% had obesity and 16.0\% were overweight. INTERPRETATION: Many high school students engage in behaviors that place them at risk for the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. The prevalence of most health behaviors varies by sex, race/ethnicity, and grade and  across states and large urban school districts. Long-term temporal changes also have occurred. Since the earliest year of data collection, the prevalence of most health-risk behaviors has decreased (e.g., riding with a driver who had been drinking alcohol, physical fighting, current cigarette use, current alcohol use,  and current sexual activity), but the prevalence of other behaviors and health outcomes has not changed (e.g., suicide attempts treated by a doctor or nurse, smokeless tobacco use, having ever used marijuana, and attending physical education classes) or has increased (e.g., having not gone to school because of safety concerns, obesity, overweight, not eating vegetables, and not drinking milk). Monitoring emerging risk behaviors (e.g., texting and driving, bullying, and electronic vapor product use) is important to understand how they might vary  over time. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: YRBSS data are used widely to compare the prevalence of health behaviors among subpopulations of students; assess trends in health behaviors over time; monitor progress toward achieving 21 national health  objectives for Healthy People 2020 and one of the 26 leading health indicators; provide comparable state and large urban school district data; and help develop and evaluate school and community policies, programs, and practices designed to decrease health-risk behaviors and improve health outcomes among youth.},

All GCC nations have made substantial investments in telecommunications and electronic health infrastructure since 2000. Methods We conducted a literature search in English and Arabic on peer-reviewed e-health research up to December 2014 originating in  the GCC. The objective was to retrieve all research on e-health in the GCC and to categorize and analyse it qualitatively to reveal the current state of e-health research and development in the region. Inclusion criteria included peer-reviewed articles, books, book chapters, conference papers and graduate theses written on  e-health in the GCC. Blogs, health websites and non-peer-reviewed literature were excluded. Results Three hundred and six articles were retrieved, categorized and  analysed qualitatively to reveal the state of e-health research in the GCC. Both  country-specific and GCC-wide major themes were identified using NVivo 10.0 qualitative software and summarized. The most common type of study was an overview (35.0\%), with common study designs of case studies (26.8\%) and descriptive articles (46.4\%). Significant themes were: prospective national benefits from e-health, implementation and satisfaction with electronic health records, online technologies in medical education, innovative systems (case studies), and information security and personal health information. Discussion This is the first comprehensive analytical literature review of e-health in the GCC. Important research gaps were identified: few cost-benefit analyses, controlled interventional studies, or research targeting gender and religious issues were retrieved.},

The project was conducted at the Camp Doha Health Clinic, located just outside Kuwait City, during the period from April 12(th) through April 23(rd), 1998. The deployed signal unit had contracted for a  direct T-1 commercial satellite link (via MCI), which allowed for direct internet connectivity using a PCMCIA network card. Digital images were sent via this connection to 140 e-mail sites throughout the world, including an unsolicited image to each of 134 Army optometry officers for their review, analysis, and diagnosis. Return responses to this unsolicited survey were 53 out of 134, for a  39.7\% response rate. Half of the respondents were able to view the image with ease and clarity, rendering an accurate clinical diagnosis. The other half of the respondents either did not have the software to display an image on their clinical desktop PC, or did not know how to use their provided software. This project clearly indicates that an off-the-shelf ophthalmic digital system can be  successfully used from a remote deployed site. However, the consulting clinicians require up-to-date training, and their computer packages should have as wide a capability base as possible.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Since 1999, the Swinfen Charitable Trust has operated an email referral system between doctors in the developing world and specialists in the industrialized world. Since 2001, it has expanded its operation into the Middle East, in particular Iraq, an area of considerable conflict. OBJECTIVES: The aim was to compare referral patterns to the Trust from the Middle East with those received from the rest of the developing world and to look for qualitative evidence of health gain. METHODS: We analyzed referrals to the Swinfen Charitable Trust between July 2004 and June 2007 and compared these by speciality with those received from elsewhere during the same 3-year period. We asked two referring doctors for their views of the process, and we analyzed the total Middle Eastern  referrals made to a single specialty (neurology). RESULTS: Between July 2004 and  June 2007, 283 referrals were received from four countries in the Middle East (Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Kuwait) and 500 cases were received from 22 other countries. The 283 cases resulted in 522 separate queries to specialists. The median time to specialist reply for the queries relating to the 283 Middle Eastern cases was 24.3 hours (interquartile range 6.1-63.3). There was a significant difference in case mix between the Middle East and the rest of the world (P {\textless} .001), with more obstetric referrals and fewer referrals in medical specialties and radiology. The referring doctors were helped greatly by the service. The neurologist was confident of the diagnosis in 20 of 26 referrals received (77\%). Both referring doctors and the specialist were able to cite referred cases where management was improved as a result of the service. CONCLUSIONS: Email telemedicine can be used in areas of conflict such as the Middle East. Perhaps surprisingly, trauma referrals are not increased but obstetric referrals are. Supporting individual doctor-patient encounters in this  way is therefore often beneficial and is easily expandable. As well as improving  care for individuals, email telemedicine provides effective case-based learning for local doctors, leading to improved care for subsequent similar patients.},

METHODS: In this cross sectional study, based on 10 categories mentioned in MPOWER 2013, a checklist was designed and its scoring was agreed upon by Iranian  and international tobacco control specialists. Seven questions were scored from 0 - 4 and 3 from 0 - 3. The 22 countries were ranked by their total score on a scale of 0 to 37. RESULTS: Among the 22 countries in the EMR, Iran, Kuwait, Egypt, Lebanon, Gaza and West bank and Jordan were scored 31, 28, 28, 26, 25 and  25 respectively. 14 countries scored more than 50\%, a small improvement; 5 countries have seen their scores fall, and three countries received the same score as last time. The highest overall improvement was attributed to the warning label, and the sharpest decline was observed in the consumption category. CONCLUSION: There has been a slight overall improvement in tobacco control planning, although the desired levels have yet to be reached and some countries in the region have fared worse.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In April 2004, the US Army Medical Department approved the use of the Army Knowledge Online (AKO) electronic e-mail system as a teleconsultation service for remote teledermatology consultations from healthcare providers in Iraq, Kuwait, and Afghanistan to medical subspecialists in the United States. The success of the system has resulted in expansion of the telemedicine program to include 11 additional clinical specialty services: (1) burn-trauma; (2) cardiology; (3) dermatology; (4) infectious disease; (5) nephrology; (6) ophthalmology; (7) pediatric intensive care; (8) preventive and occupational medicine; (9) neurology; (10) rheumatology; and (11) toxicology. The goal of the  program is to provide a mechanism for enhanced diagnosis of remote cases resulting in a better evacuation system (i.e., only evacuation of appropriate cases). The service provides a standard practice for managing acute and emergent  care requests between remote medical providers in austere environments and rear-based specialists in a timely and consistent manner. METHODS: Consults are generated using the AKO e-mail system routed through a contact group composed of  volunteer, on-call consults. The project manager receives and monitors all teleconsultations to ensure Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliance and consultant's recommendations are transmitted within a 24-hour mandated time period. A subspecialty "clinical champion" is responsible for recruiting consultants to answer teleconsultations and developing a call schedule for each specialty. Subspecialties may have individual consultants on call for specific days (e.g., dermatology and toxicology) or place entire groups on-call for a designated period of time (e.g., ophthalmology). RESULTS: As of May 2007, 2,337 consults were performed during 36 months, with an average reply time of five hours from receipt of the teleconsultation until a recommendation was sent to the referring physician. Most consultations have been for dermatology (66\%), followed by infectious disease (10\%). A total of 51 known evacuations were prevented from use of the program, while 63 known evacuations have resulted following receipt of the consultants' recommendation. A total of 313 teleconsultations also have been performed for non-US patients, CONCLUSIONS: The  teleconsultation program has proven to be a valuable resource for physicians deployed in austere and remote locations. Furthermore, use of such a system for physicians in austere environments may prevent unnecessary evacuations or result  in appropriate evacuations for patients who initially may have been "underdiagnosed."},

This study discovers the best design parameters for a data compression scheme applied  to digital magnetic resonance (MR) images. The proposed technique aims at reducing the transmission cost while preserving the diagnostic information. By selecting the wavelet packet's filters, decomposition level, and subbands that are better adapted to the frequency characteristics of the image, one may achieve better image representation in the sense of lower entropy or minimal distortion.  Experimental results show that the selection of the best parameters has a dramatic effect on the data compression rate of MR images. In all cases, decomposition at three or four levels with the Coiflet 5 wavelet (Coif 5) results in better compression performance than the other wavelets. Image resolution is found to have a remarkable effect on the compression rate.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is taking a toll on the world's health care infrastructure as well as the social, economic, and psychological well-being of humanity. Individuals, organizations, and governments are using social media to communicate with each other on a number of issues relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. Not much is known about the topics being shared on social media platforms relating to COVID-19. Analyzing such information can help policy makers and health care organizations assess the needs of their stakeholders and address them appropriately.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the main topics posted by Twitter users related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: Leveraging a set of tools (Twitter's search application programming interface (API), Tweepy Python library, and PostgreSQL database) and using a set of predefined search terms ("corona," "2019-nCov," and "COVID-19"), we extracted the text and metadata (number of likes and retweets, and user profile information including the number of followers) of public English language tweets from February 2, 2020, to March 15, 2020. We analyzed the collected tweets using word frequencies of single (unigrams) and double words (bigrams). We leveraged latent Dirichlet allocation for topic modeling to identify topics discussed in the tweets. We also performed sentiment analysis and extracted the mean number of retweets, likes, and followers for each topic and calculated the interaction rate per topic.
RESULTS: Out of approximately 2.8 million tweets included, 167,073 unique tweets from 160,829 unique users met the inclusion criteria. Our analysis identified 12 topics, which were grouped into four main themes: origin of the virus; its sources; its impact on people, countries, and the economy; and ways of mitigating the risk of infection. The mean sentiment was positive for 10 topics and negative for 2 topics (deaths caused by COVID-19 and increased racism). The mean for tweet topics of account followers ranged from 2722 (increased racism) to 13,413 (economic losses). The highest mean of likes for the tweets was 15.4 (economic loss), while the lowest was 3.94 (travel bans and warnings).
CONCLUSIONS: Public health crisis response activities on the ground and online are becoming increasingly simultaneous and intertwined. Social media provides an opportunity to directly communicate health information to the public. Health systems should work on building national and international disease detection and surveillance systems through monitoring social media. There is also a need for a more proactive and agile public health presence on social media to combat the spread of fake news.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study is to evaluate the current state of accessibility of higher education institution websites in the State of Kuwait. Using a quantitative approach, websites of higher education institutions were evaluated for their conformance to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0) standard. A total of 41 higher education homepages and college landing pages were evaluated. The following software conformance tools and metrics were used: AChecker, Total Validator, WAVE and HTML/CSS/ARIA. The evaluation was followed by a systematic analysis of the results, a comparison to other areas of accessibility research, and putting forth a set of recommendations for the improvement in higher education website accessibility. None of the higher education websites fully conformed to the WCAG 2.0 Level A standard across all tools used. The lowest ranking pages (24\% of all pages) had an error rate above 35\% across all aspects of the WCAG 2.0 guidelines. The majority of errors, at both WCAG 2.0 levels A and AA, fell under the perceivable criteria. Overall, the analysis suggested that accessibility was not accounted for during the website development and that careful re-design and repair of current issues should be a top priority. There is an urgent need to solve accessibility violations in higher education institution websites in Kuwait to support people with disabilities. Educational institutions should develop and enforce policies and laws as well as increase awareness of the WCAG standard amongst IT managers and developers. The institutions should also invest in their developers’ accessibility training and research as well as account for routine reviews of their web pages by people with disabilities and experts.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mental disorders are a major public health problem leading to premature mortality, homelessness, addiction problems, poor physical health, and suicide. The prevalence of mental disorders in Arab countries, is high. The proliferation and ubiquity of smartphones and their apps in the Arab world may be the long-awaited for digital therapeutic for mental health disorders. However, the evidence about the availability and characteristics of mental health apps available to Arabic speakers remains poor.
OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic assessment of the features of depression and anxiety mobile apps available for Arabic speakers.
METHODS: A critical review of all the currently available depression and anxiety apps, available free of charge to Arabic speakers. The apps are evaluated using the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS). Further, a categorization of apps' main functions, inspired by the mhGAP guidelines, is developed to classify the apps based on their main functions.
RESULTS: A total of 23 apps are identified with far more apps available on the Google Play Store (n = 21) versus only two apps on the iOS App Store. The majority of the apps (n = 16) provide general information about either anxiety, depression, or both. Six apps are of spiritual nature mainly referring to the Islamic faith and the Holy Quran, with one app referring to the Christian faith. Another five apps provide advice on alternative treatments, mainly concerning herbal medicine recipes. Only two apps provided utilities for users, specifically about medication reminders.
CONCLUSIONS: Mental health digi-threaputics have huge potentials to transform mental health care delivery. However, more empirical studies are needed to assure their quality and efficacy. The results of this study clearly highlight the current gaps to address the needs of Arabic speakers; only 23 apps were identified in this study, mostly with low app quality scores. There is a need to involve expert healthcare professionals in the development of mental health apps and for healthcare providers to empower patients through discussing apps that are useful and discern them from those that can potentially cause harm.},

OBJECTIVE:: (i) to uncover the status quo of information management practices in public hospitals and (ii) to offer recommendations to improve them.
METHOD:: This study analysed qualitative and quantitative accreditation-related data pertaining to the compliance with the information management standard at all secondary care public hospitals over two accreditation cycles.
RESULTS:: Overall, public hospitals had made positive progress in their compliance with the information management standard. However, issues still existed with (i) developing and implementing an information management plan, (ii) involving the appropriate stakeholders in selecting health IT solutions and (iii) access to the Internet by staff and patients.
CONCLUSION:: Evidence underscored the importance of proper information management driven by clear centralised strategic plans.
IMPLICATIONS:: With the rapid adoption of digital health systems, the role of health information management leaders should not be undervalued. Embracing health IT solutions with strong information management practices can aid healthcare reform efforts.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current advances in information and communication technology have made accessing and obtaining health-related information easier than ever before. Today, many hospital websites use a patient-centric approach to promote engagement and encourage learning for better health-related decision making. However, little is known about the current state of hospital websites in the State of Kuwait. This study aims to evaluate hospital websites in Kuwait and offer recommendations to improve patient engagement and access to health information.
METHODS: This study employs a cross-sectional analytical approach to evaluate hospital websites in Kuwait in 2017. The websites of hospitals that provide in-patient services were identified through a structured search. Only active websites that were available in either English or Arabic were considered. The evaluation of the websites involved a combination of automated and expert- based evaluation methods and was performed across four dimensions: Accessibility, Usability, Presence, and Content.
RESULTS: Nine hospitals met the inclusion criteria. Most of the websites fell short in all four dimensions. None of the websites passed the accessibility guidelines. The usability of websites varied between hospitals. Overall, the majority of hospitals in Kuwait have rudimentary online presence and their websites require careful reassessment with respect to design, content, and user experience. The websites focus primarily on promoting services provided by the hospital rather than engaging and communicating with patients or providing evidence-based information.
CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare organization and website developers should follow best-practices to improve their websites taking into consideration the quality, readability, objectivity, coverage and currency of the information as well as the design of their websites. Hospitals should leverage social media to gain outreach and better engagement with consumers. The websites should be offered in additional languages commonly spoken by people living in Kuwait. Efforts should be made to ensure that health information on hospital websites are evidence-based and checked by healthcare professionals.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The internet and social media have become an important source for health information. In 2017, the State of Kuwait ranked first in mobile subscription penetration in the Arab world; nearly 90\% of its population uses the internet. Electronic health (eHealth) literacy is important in populations that have easy and affordable access to internet resources to more effectively manage health conditions as well as improve general population health.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess eHealth literacy levels across internet users in Kuwait and identify demographic characteristics that influence eHealth literacy. Furthermore, the study aimed to identify the reasons and type of information that people seek online. Finally, this study examined the utilization of various social media channels for accessing online health information. The social media platforms considered were as follows: WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, and Snapchat.
METHODS: A cross-sectional anonymous Web-based survey was used to collect data about eHealth literacy and related information. The eHealth literacy scale (eHEALS), originally developed by Norman and Skinner, is measured using 8 Likert-type scales. A linear regression model estimates the effect of demographic variables such as age, gender, and education on eHealth literacy while controlling for participants' perceived usefulness and importance of the internet. Participants were also surveyed about their frequency in using social media platforms for seeking health information.
RESULTS: Kuwait's composite eHEALS, based on a sample of 386 participants, was 28.63, which is very similar to eHEALS observed among adult populations in other developed countries. Females in Kuwait demonstrated a higher average eHEALS compared with males. Among the social media platforms, the survey results indicated that YouTube is the most frequently used to seek health information, with Facebook being the least frequently used.
CONCLUSIONS: Internet users in Kuwait appear confident in their ability to search for health-related information online compared with other populations, as indicated by aggregate eHEALS scores. Considering this finding, government and health care organizations should shift more efforts from traditional media toward online health information, focusing on the social media outlets that people in Kuwait find more useful for seeking health information.},
