	abstract = {Today, 415 million adults have diabetes; more than 35 million of diabetic adults live in the Middle East and North Africa region. Smartphone penetration in the region is high and applications, or apps, for diabetics have shown promising results in recent years. This study took place between September and December 2015 and reviewed all currently available smartphone diabetes apps for Arabic speakers in both the Apple App and Google Play stores. There were only few diabetes apps for Arabic speakers; only eighteen apps were discovered and considered for this study. Most apps were informational. Only three apps offered utilities such as glucose reading conversion. The apps had issues related to information quality and adherence to latest evidence-based medical advice. There is a need for more evidence-based Arabic diabetes apps with improved functionality. Future research of Arabic diabetes apps should also focus on the involvement and engagement of the patients in the design of these apps.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: From the perspectives of home care patients and caregivers, this study aimed to (a) identify the challenges for better fall-risk management during home care episodes and (b) explore the opportunities for them to leverage health information technology (IT) solutions to improve fall-risk management during home care episodes.
METHODS: Twelve in-depth semistructured interviews with the patients and caregivers were conducted within a descriptive single case study design in 1 home health agency (HHA) in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States.
RESULTS: Patients and caregivers faced challenges to manage fall risks such as unmanaged expectations, deteriorating cognitive abilities, and poor care coordination between the HHA and physician practices. Opportunities to leverage health IT solutions included patient portals, telehealth, and medication reminder apps on smartphones.
CONCLUSION: Effectively leveraging health IT could further empower patients and caregivers to reduce fall risks by acquiring the necessary information and following clinical advice and recommendations. The HHAs could improve the quality of care by adopting IT solutions that show more promise of improving the experiences of patients and caregivers in fall-risk management.},
